.SH DESCRIPTION
The real and effective group ID's of the current process
are set to the arguments.

of a process.  Unpriviledged users may change the
effective group ID to the real group ID, but to
no other.

group ID forces the system to substitute the current
ID in place of the \-1 parameter.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of \-1 is returned and \fIerrno\fP is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS
.TP 15

other than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id
was specified.
