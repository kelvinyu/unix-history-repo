Description:

Sccstorcs builds an RCS Revision Control System file from an SCCS
Source Code Control System file. The deltas and comments for each
delta are preserved and installed into the new RCS file in order.
Also preserved are the user access list and descriptive text, if
any, from the SCCS file.
