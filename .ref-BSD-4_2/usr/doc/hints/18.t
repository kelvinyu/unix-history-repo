.sh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This document represents a lot of work.  It would have been easier, except
for everyone who sent us helpful hints and suggestions and, in
general, kept us honest.
In particular, we would like to acknowledge all those vendors
who were patient with us, especially those whose products were ultimately
not included.
George Goble at Purdue made several
helpful comments which greatly improved the content of the
document, and his experiences with Fujitsu Eagles has made
a significant impression on us.
The DEC DSA engineering team in Colorado Springs, including Paul Massiglia,
Bill Grace and Chuck Hess were particularly generous with their time and
energies.
Peter Weinberger of Bell Laboratories shared his experiences with the
UDA50/RA81 with us.
Kirk McKusick spent
time traveling to Colorado Springs to aid in evaluating the
DEC RA81 disk drive.  David Mosher has worked diligently as the
purchasing agent for CSRG and also contributed to our understanding
of the subtler points of disk manufacturing and operation.
Jim Reeds gave the paper a careful proof reading and found many
oversights.
