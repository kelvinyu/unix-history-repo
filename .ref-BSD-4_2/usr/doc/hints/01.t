This documents reflects our \fIpersonal opinions\fP.  We are responsible
for software and hardware support of VAX systems, and the recommendations we
give reflect what we would do.  We are careful to note the equipment that
we recommend but are not using; we recommend no second-vendor
equipment that is not known to be in use successfully at several 
UNIX sites.  In any case you may get a lemon, no matter what you buy.
All we promise is that this is what we believe.
Let us know what you find out.

Recommendations made here should not be construed to be applicable to
any operating system other than UNIX.
We have often adapted UNIX to these devices in a way that may
not be possible with other operating systems.
