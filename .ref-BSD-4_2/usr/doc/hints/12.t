.sh "SOFTWARE SUPPORT"
There has been increasing demand
for 4BSD at commercial installations in a form less expensive and
more digestible than a source license from Western Electric and
an unsupported distribution from Berkeley.
A number of companies, licensed by Western Electric
to sell and support UNIX in binary form,
are now distributing 4BSD.
Some of these companies support 4BSD as an enhancement
for their hardware offerings others deal only in software.
Licenses from
these vendors normally cost much less than a UNIX
source code license.
These companies usually try to make 4BSD more
palatable to the non-academic community by
providing more first-time user documentation
and specialized consulting addressing specific
customer applications.
More formal software support arrangements than those offered by
U. C. Berkeley are also available.
4BSD software sales and support vendors are included in the list at
the end of this paper.
