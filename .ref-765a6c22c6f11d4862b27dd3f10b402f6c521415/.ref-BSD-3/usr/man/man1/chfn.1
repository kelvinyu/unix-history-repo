.TH CHFN 1 10/11/79
.UC
.SH NAME
chfn \- change full name of user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chfn
name
string
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Chfn
is a command similar to
.IR passwd (1)
except that it is used to change the gecos field of the password
file rather than the password entry.
Note that the string specified will replace the gecos field of the
specified user.
If (as on the UCB system) this field contains information in addition
to the user's full name, this information must be included in string
or it will be deleted.
Hence chfn can be used to fix phone numbers, offices, etc.
.PP
An example use of this command would be
.PP
.DT
	chfn mark \'& Horton,7686,508E,5240633\'
.PP
Note that the string must in general be quoted to shield blanks
and special characters from the shell.
The field should consist of the users name, followed by the last 4 digits
of their office extension, followed by their office number and finally their
home phone number.  Any of these can be eliminated.
At UCB, offices can be given as ``508E'' for 508 Evans, and ``187MC'' for
187M Cory.
.PP
It is a good idea to run 
.IR finger (1)
on the user before and after
.I chfn
to make sure you have formatted the data correctly.

.SH BUGS
The encoding of the office and extension information is installation dependent.
