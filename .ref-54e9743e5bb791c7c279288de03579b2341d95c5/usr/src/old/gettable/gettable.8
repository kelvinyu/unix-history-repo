.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Gettable
is a simple program used to obtain the
.Tn NIC
standard
host tables from a
.Dq nicname
server.  The indicated
.Ar host
is queried for the tables.  The tables, if retrieved,
are placed in the file
.Ar outfile
or by default,
.Pa hosts.txt .
.Pp
Available option:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Get just the version number instead of the complete host table
and put the output in the file
.Ar outfile
or by default,
.Pa hosts.ver .
.El
.Pp
.Nm Gettable
operates by opening a
.Tn TCP
connection to the port indicated
in the service specification for ``nicname''.  A request
is then made for
.Dq ALL
names and the resultant information
is placed in the output file.
.Pp
.Nm Gettable
is best used in conjunction with the
.Xr htable 8
program which converts the
.Tn NIC
standard file format to
that used by the network library lookup routines.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 3 ,
.Xr htable 8 ,
.Xr named 8
.Sh BUGS
If the name-domain system provided network name mapping well as host
name mapping,
.Nm gettable
would no longer be needed.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
