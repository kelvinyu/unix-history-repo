/*
 * In the swap pager, the backing store for an object is organized as an
 * array of some number of "swap blocks".  A swap block consists of a bitmask
 * and some number of contiguous DEV_BSIZE disk blocks.  The minimum size
 * of a swap block is:
 *
 *	max(PAGE_SIZE, dmmin*DEV_BSIZE)			[ 32k currently ]
 *
 * bytes (since the pager interface is page oriented), the maximum size is:
 *
 *	min(#bits(swb_mask)*PAGE_SIZE, dmmax*DEV_BSIZE)	[ 128k currently ]
 *
 * where dmmin and dmmax are left over from the old VM interface.  The bitmask
 * (swb_mask) is used by swap_pager_haspage() to determine if a particular
 * page has actually been written; i.e. the pager copy of the page is valid.
 * All swap blocks in the backing store of an object will be the same size.
 *
 * The reason for variable sized swap blocks is to reduce fragmentation of
 * swap resources.  Whenever possible we allocate smaller swap blocks to
 * smaller objects.  The swap block size is determined from a table of
 * object-size vs. swap-block-size computed at boot time.
