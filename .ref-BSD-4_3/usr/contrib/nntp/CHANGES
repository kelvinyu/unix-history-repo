1.2a	20 March 1986

	common/conf.h defined MAX_GROUPS as 300; this was too low on
	some machines.  Upped to 450.  [solex@rice.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	rrn/Makefile.sh had .c instead of .o for OBJS and SRCS
	respectively.  Also had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o (see below).

	inews/inews.c had (char *) 0 for gets(), which made SUN's upset.
	Changed to simply NULL. [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	inews/Makefile had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o which some
	machines don't do.  [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	common/clientlib.c has "untp" instead of "nntp".

	server/active.c made more robust about reading active file
	if active file is longer than MAX_GROUPS.

	server/common.h included common/conf.h after checking for
	DBM, which caused some problems.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2	15 March 1986

	Released.
