This release of Version 5.9 of Icon is tailored to the 4.3bsd distribution
of user-contributed software.

To build the system, type:

	make all
	
To install the various components for general use, type:

	make install
	
This will place the user-level programs icont and icon-pi in /usr/new; make
a library directory /usr/new/lib/icon and copy in several files which are
used by icont; and place man pages for icont and icon-pi in /usr/man/mann.
"make all" is a subset of "make install".  One needs to be super-user to
do the installations.

The system is configured to run with binaries in /usr/new and the
executable library in /usr/new/lib/icon.  To change this, it is necessary
modify the Setup entry in the Makefile.  Consult tr84-13 in the docs
subdirectory prior to installation if this is required.  The makefile
entry setup-pwd configures Icon to run with the library programs (which
normally reside in /usr/new/lib/icon) in ./bin.

Note that various Icon documents refer to system as being rooted at "v5g"
but the normal v5g directory is not in this distribution.  Whenever documents
talk about v5g/... this refers to /usr/src/new/icon/... in this distribution.

"make clean" removes object files and other files that are built by the
compilation of the system.  Executables in ./bin are not removed.

Troff sources for documents related to Version 5.9 of Icon are contained
in the "docs" directory.  See "READ.ME" there.

In addition to Icon proper, there is a library of Icon programs with
manual pages and a "personalized interpreter" system for persons who
want private versions of Icon with their own modifications.
See docs/tr84-13 for more information and pointers to other documents.
