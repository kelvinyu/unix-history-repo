The Icon programs in this directory are constructed from files of
Icon expressions, using the program buildt.icn. For example, to
create a new test program testx.icn from the list of expressions
in testx.inp,

	buildt <testx.inp >testx.icn

A general framework is put around each program to facilitate testing
of records and such.  See any file produced by buildt.icn for an example.

There is complementary program, dismem.icn that takes test programs
build by buildt.icn and produces the corresponding list of expressions,
as in

	dismem <testx.icn >testx.inp
