.SH NAME
Size \- size of Icon object
.SH DESCRIPTION
The procedure \*MSize(x)\fR produces the
size, in bytes, of \*Mx\fR.
.PP
There is an optional second argument, which specifies the machine
word size, in bits. For example, \*MSize(x,\*b16)\fR produces the
size of \*Mx\fR on a 16-bit machine. Only word sizes of 16 and 32
are supported; the default, in the absence of the second argument,
is 32.
.SH CAVEATS
The sizes given are approximate for many objects. The following
interpretations are made in determining sizes:
.IP "" .2i
Strings are counted as distinct; no allowance is made for shared
usage of storage.
.IP
The size of procedures may be underestimated.
.IP
The size of co-expressions is approximate and does not take into
account space for the local identifiers and related information.
.IP
The size of lists that are augmented by stack and queue functions
may be underestimated.
.IP
Sizes are based on parameters as given in the Icon system as it
is distributed; local changes may affect the sizes of some objects.
