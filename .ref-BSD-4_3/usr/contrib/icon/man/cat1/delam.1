     _D_e_l_a_m delaminates an input file into several output files
     according to the fields specified by ffffiiiieeeellllddddlllliiiisssstttt.  _D_e_l_a_m reads
     iiiinnnnffffiiiilllleeee and writes the fields in each line to the correspond-
     ing output files as individual lines. If no data occurs in
     the specified position for a given input line an empty out-
     put line is written. This insures that all output files con-
     tain the same number of lines as the input file.

     If `-' is used for iiiinnnnffffiiiilllleeee, the standard input is read.  If
     `-' is used as an output file name, the corresponding field
     is written to the standard output.

     The fields are defined by ffffiiiieeeellllddddlllliiiisssstttt, which is a list of
     field specifications, separated by commas, colons, or semi-
     colons, of the following form:

          _n         the character in column _n
          _n-_m       the characters in columns _n through _m
          _n+_m       _m characters beginning at column _n

     where the columns in a line are numbered from 1 to the
     length of the line.

     The use of _d_e_l_a_m is illustrated by the following examples.

          delam 1-10,5 foo x y

     reads file _f_o_o and writes characters 1 through 10 to file _x
     and character 5 to file _y.

          delam 10+5:1-10:1-10:80 - middle left1 left2 end

     reads the standard input and writes characters 10 through 14
     to _m_i_d_d_l_e, 1 through 10 to _l_e_f_t_1 and _l_e_f_t_2, and character 80
     to _e_n_d.

          delam 1-80;1-80 - - -

     copies the standard input to the standard output, replicat-
     ing the first eighty columns of each line twice.

     The functionality of the Software Tools _d_e_l_a_m has been
     divided. The Icon version of _d_e_l_a_m uses an extended
     fieldlist syntax.
