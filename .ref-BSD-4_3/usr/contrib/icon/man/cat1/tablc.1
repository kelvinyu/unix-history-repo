     _T_a_b_l_c tabulates the characters in standard input and writes
     a summary to standard output in which each character and the
     number of times it occurs is listed. Characters are written
     using Icon's escape conventions.

     The following options may appear in any order:

     ----aaaa     Write the summary in alphabetical order of the char-
            acters. This is the default.

     ----nnnn     Write the summary in numerical order of the counts.

     ----uuuu     Write only the characters that occur just once.
