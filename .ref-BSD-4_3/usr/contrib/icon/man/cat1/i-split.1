     _I-_s_p_l_i_t reads an Icon program from standard input and writes
     each procedure to a separate file. The output file names
     consist of the procedure name with ....iiiiccccnnnn appended.  If the ----gggg
     option is specified, any global, external, and record
     declarations are written to that file. Otherwise they are
     written in the file for the procedure that immediately fol-
     lows them.

     Comments and white space between declarations are attached
     to the next following declaration.

     _I-_s_p_l_i_t only recognizes declarations that start at the
     beginning of lines.

     Comments and interline white space between declarations may
     not come out as intended.

     If the ----gggg option is not specified, any global, external, or
     record declarations that follow the last procedure are dis-
     carded.
