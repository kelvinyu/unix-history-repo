     _L_a_b_e_l_s writes labels onto the standard output using coded
     information taken from standard input.  In the input, a line
     beginning with #### is a label header.  Subsequent lines up to
     the next header or end-of-file are accumulated and output so
     as to be centered horizontally and vertically on pin-feed
     label forms.  Lines beginning with **** are treated as comments
     and are ignored.

     The following options may appear in any order:

     -_n     Print _n copies of each label.

     ----ssss _s_t_r_i_n_g
            Select only those labels whose headers contain a
            character in _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     ----tttt     Format for curved tape labels (the default is to for-
            mat for rectangular mailing labels).

     Label forms should be used with a pin-feed platen.  For
     mailing labels, the carriage should be adjusted so that the
     first character is printed at the leftmost position on the
     label and so that the first line of the output is printed on
     the topmost line of the label.  Since tape labels are
     curved, some experimentation may be required to get the text
     positioned properly.

     Label lines may be at most 40 characters long and there may
     be at most eight lines per label.  If these limits are
     exceeded, a label with an error message is formatted onto
     standard error output.  Thus if standard output and standard
     error output are directed to the same file, an erroneous
     label does not result in misformatting of the other labels.
