cppp \- cp preprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3cppp\fP [\f3\-d\fR identifiers] [\f3\-u\fR identifiers]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fICppp\fR filters standard input to standard output, processing the
C preprocessor control lines \*M#ifdef\fR,
\*M#ifndef\fR, and \*M#else\fR. If the controlling identifier is
in the arguments following the \f3\-d\fR option, the corresponding
lines are included, while if the controlling identifier is in the
arguments following the \f3\-u\fR option, the corresponding lines
are deleted. Otherwise, the preprocessor control lines are included.
The control lines \*M#define\fR and \*M#undef\fR are deleted if
the identifier is in either list.
.PP
For example, suppose that a program contains code for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit processors
under control of the identifiers \*MBIT8\fR, \*MBIT16\fR, and \*MBITB2\fR.
A version
of the program for 16-bit processors only can be obtained by
.DS
cppp \-d BIT16 \-u BIT8 BIT32
.DE
.SH LIMITATION
\fICppp\fR assumes the input file is syntactically correct with respect
to control lines.
