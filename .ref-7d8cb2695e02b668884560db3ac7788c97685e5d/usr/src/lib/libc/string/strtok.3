.Sh NAME
.Nm strtok ,
.Nm strsep
.Nd string token operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <string.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn strtok "char *str" "const char *sep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by strsep(3).
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn strtok
function
is used to isolate sequential tokens in a null-terminated string,
.Fa str .
These tokens are separated in the string by at least one of the
characters in
.Fa sep .
The first time that
.Fn strtok
is called,
.Fa str
should be specified; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain further tokens
from the same string, should pass a null pointer instead.
The separator string,
.Fa sep ,
must be supplied each time, and may change between calls.
.Pp
The
.Fn strtok
function
returns a pointer to the beginning of each subsequent token in the string,
after replacing the token itself with a
.Dv NUL
character.
When no more tokens remain, a null pointer is returned.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strtok
function
conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to get tokens from multiple strings simultaneously.
.Pp
The System V
.Fn strtok ,
if handed a string containing only delimiter characters,
will not alter the next starting point, so that a call to
.Fn strtok
with a different (or empty) delimiter string
may return a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
value.
Since this implementation always alters the next starting point,
such a sequence of calls would always return
.Dv NULL .
