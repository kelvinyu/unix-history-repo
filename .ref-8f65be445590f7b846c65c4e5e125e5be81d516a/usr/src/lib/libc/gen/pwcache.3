.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft B
This interface is not part of the C library.
It has been placed in the Berkeley utility library, libutil, as it is
used by several standard utilities.
.ft R
.PP
The
.I user_from_uid
function returns the user name associated with the argument uid.
The user name is cached so that multiple calls with the same uid 
do not require additional calls to
.IR getpwuid (3).
If there is no user associated with the uid, a pointer is returned
to an ASCII representation of the uid, unless the argument
.I nouser
is non-zero, in which case a NULL pointer is returned.
.PP
The
.I group_from_gid
function returns the group name associated with the argument gid.
The group name is cached so that multiple calls with the same gid
do not require additional calls to
.IR getgrgid (3).
If there is no group associated with the gid, a pointer is returned
to an ASCII representation of the gid, unless the argument
.I nogroup
is non-zero, in which case a NULL pointer is returned.
.SH SEE ALSO
getgrgid(3), getpwuid(3)
