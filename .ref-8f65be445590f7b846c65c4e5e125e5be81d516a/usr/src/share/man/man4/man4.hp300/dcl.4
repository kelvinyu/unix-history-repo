98628A communications link
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device dcl0 at scode? flags 0x1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 98628A is a buffered
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface.
It has one port with full modem control.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
0, 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200.
.Pp
An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired with
carrier always present, or to 0 if modem control is desired.
.Pp
Use
.Tn HP
cable "98626 & 98628 opts.002,
.Tn RS232-C
.Tn DCE CABLE ,
5061-4216" to attach non-modem devices.
Use
.Tn HP
cable "98626 & 98628 opts.001,
.Tn RS232-C
.Tn DTE CABLE ,
5061-4215" to attach modems.
.Pp
The 98628A has a 256 byte input silo and a 256 output silo. Input interrupts
happen on a per character basis.
.Pp
The high water and low water marks in the kernel tty routines are completely
inappropriate for a device like this with a large input buffer.  Don't use
tandem mode if possible.  A fast system can handle input at 19.2K baud without
receive overflow.
.Pp
For output to devices that make heavy use of
.Tn XON/XOFF
a write size of less
then 256 will improve performance marginally.
