.Sh NAME
.Nm dmv
.Nd
.Tn DEC
.Tn DMV-11
point-to-point communications device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device dmv0 at uba0 csr 167000 vector dmvrint dmvxint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm dmv
interface provides access to a point-to-point communications
device which runs at up to 56 Kb/s.
.Tn DMV-11 Ns s
communicate
using the
.Tn DEC
.Tn DDCMP
link layer protocol.
.Pp
The host's address must be specified with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
and the destination address specified with a
.Dv SIOCSIFDSTADDR
.Xr ioctl ,
before the interface will transmit or receive any packets.
.Sh ROUTING
The driver places a
.Tn HOST
entry in the kernel routing tables for the
address given in the
.Dv SIOCSIFDSTADDR
.Xr ioctl .
To use the
.Tn DMV
as a
link between local nets, the route to the remote net must be added manually
with the
.Xr route 8
command, or by the use of the routing process
.Xr routed 8
on each end of the link.
