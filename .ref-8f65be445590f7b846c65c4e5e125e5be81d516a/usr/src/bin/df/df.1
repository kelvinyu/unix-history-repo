.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl ikn
.Op Ar file Li \&| Ar filesystem \&...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Df
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
filesystem
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
If neither a file or a filesystem argument is given,
statistics for every filesystem mounted is displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Tw Ds
.Tp Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.Tp Fl k
By default, all reported numbers are in 512-byte blocks.
This causes the numbers to be reported in kilobytes.
.Tp Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used
if it is possible that one or more filesystems are
in a state such that they will not be able
to provide statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the filesystems,
but will respond with the possibly stale statistics
that were previously obtained.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl n
flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
