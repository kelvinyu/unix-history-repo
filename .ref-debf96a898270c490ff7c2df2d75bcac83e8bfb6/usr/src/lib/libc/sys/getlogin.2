.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
getlogname(name, namelen)
char *name;
int namelen;
.PP
.ft B
setlogname(name, namelen)
char *name;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getlogname
returns the login name of the owner of the current process, as
previously set by
.IR setlogname . 
The parameter
.I namelen
specifies the size of the 
.I name
array.  The returned name is null-terminated unless insufficient
space is provided.
The preferred method for retrieving this information is through the
.IR getlogin (3)
library routine.
.PP
.I Setlogname
sets the login name of the process owner to be
.IR name ,
which has length
.IR namelen .
This call is restricted to the super-user and
is normally used only at login time, or when a remote shell
is invoked.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
If the call succeeds, a value of 0 is returned.  If the call
fails, then a value of \-1 is returned and an error code is
placed in the global location \fIerrno\fP.
.SH "ERRORS
The following errors may be returned by these calls:
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
The \fIname\fP or \fInamelen\fP parameter gave an
invalid address.
.TP 15
[EPERM]
The caller tried to set the hostname and was not the super-user.
.SH SEE ALSO
getlogin(3)
.SH BUGS
Host names are limited to MAXLOGNAME (from
.IR <sys/user.h> )
characters, currently 12.
