.SH NAME
nice \- run a command at low priority (\fIsh\fR only)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nice
[
.BI \- number
]
command [ arguments ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nice
executes
.I command
with low scheduling priority.
If the
.I number
argument is present, the priority is incremented (higher
numbers mean lower priorities) by that amount up to a limit of 20.
The default
.I number
is 10.
.PP
The super-user may run commands with
priority higher than normal
by using a negative priority,
e.g. `\-\-10'.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
csh(1), nice(1), setpriority(2), renice(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I Nice
returns the exit status of the subject command.
.SH BUGS
.I Nice
is particular to
.IR sh (1).
If you use
.IR csh (1),
then commands executed with ``&'' are automatically immune to hangup
signals while in the background.
.PP
.I Nice
is built into
.IR csh (1)
with a slightly different syntax than described here.  The form
``nice +10'' nices to positive nice, and ``nice \-10'' can be used
by the super-user to give a process more of the processor.
