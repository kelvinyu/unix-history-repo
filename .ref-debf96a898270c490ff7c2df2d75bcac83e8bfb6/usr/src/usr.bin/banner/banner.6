.SH NAME
banner \- print large banner on printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/banner
[
.BI \-w n
]
message ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Banner
prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.
If the message is omitted, it prompts for and
reads one line of its standard input.  If
.B \-w
is given, the output is scrunched down from a width of 132 to
.I n ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.  If
.I n
is omitted, it defaults to 80.
.PP
The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages. The volume is great enough that you 
may want
a printer or a fast hardcopy terminal, but if you are patient, a
decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.
.SH BUGS
Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \\,
^, _, {, }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny
looking (but in a useful way.)
.PP
The
.B \-w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
