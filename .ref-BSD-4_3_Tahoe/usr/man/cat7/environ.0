     An array of strings called the _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t is made available
     by _e_x_e_c_v_e(2) when a process begins.  By convention these
     strings have the form ``_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e''.  The following names
     are used by various commands:

     EXINIT   A startup list of commands read by _e_x(1), _e_d_i_t(1),
	      and _v_i(1).

     HOME     A user's login directory, set by _l_o_g_i_n(1) from the
	      password file _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

     PATH     The sequence of directories, separated by colons,
	      searched by _c_s_h(1), _s_h(1), _s_y_s_t_e_m(3), _e_x_e_c_v_p(3),
	      etc, when looking for an executable file.  PATH is
	      set to ``:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin'' initially by
	      _l_o_g_i_n(1).

     PRINTER  The name of the default printer to be used by
	      _l_p_r(1), _l_p_q(1), and _l_p_r_m(1).

     SHELL    The full pathname of the user's login shell.

     TERM     The kind of terminal for which output is to be
	      prepared.  This information is used by commands,
	      such as _n_r_o_f_f(1) or _p_l_o_t(1G), which may exploit
	      special terminal capabilities.  See /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p
	      (_t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5)) for a list of terminal types.

     TERMCAP  The string describing the terminal in TERM, or, if
	      it begins with a '/', the name of the termcap file.
	      See TERMPATH below, _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5), and _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(3X).

     TERMPATH A sequence of pathnames of termcap files, separated
	      by colons or spaces, which are searched for termi-
	      nal descriptions in the order listed.  Having no
	      TERMPATH is equivalent to a TERMPATH of
	      ``$HOME/.termcap:/etc/termcap''.	TERMPATH is
	      ignored if TERMCAP contains a full pathname.

     USER     The login name of the user.

     Further names may be placed in the environment by the _e_x_p_o_r_t
     command and _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e arguments in _s_h(1), or by the _s_e_t_e_n_v
     command if you use _c_s_h(1).  It is unwise to change certain
     _s_h(1) variables that are frequently exported by ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e
