     The current process is suspended from execution for the
     number of seconds specified by the argument.  The actual
     suspension time may be up to 1 second less than that
     requested, because scheduled wakeups occur at fixed 1-second
     intervals, and an arbitrary amount longer because of other
     activity in the system.

     The routine is implemented by setting an interval timer and
     pausing until it occurs.  The previous state of this timer
     is saved and restored.  If the sleep time exceeds the time
     to the expiration of the previous timer, the process sleeps
     only until the signal would have occurred, and the signal is
     sent 1 second later.
