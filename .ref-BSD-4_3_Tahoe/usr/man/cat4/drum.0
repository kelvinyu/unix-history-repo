     drum - paging device

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This file refers to the paging device in use by the system.
     This may actually be a subdevice of one of the disk drivers,
     but in a system with paging interleaved across multiple disk
     drives it provides an indirect driver for the multiple
     drives.

BBUUGGSS
     Reads from the drum are not allowed across the interleaving
     boundaries.  Since these only occur every ..5Mbytes or so,
     and since the system never allocates blocks across the boun-
     dary, this is usually not a problem.
