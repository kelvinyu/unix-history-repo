     _L_p provides the interface to any of the standard DEC line
     printers on an LP-11 parallel interface.  When it is opened
     or closed, a suitable number of page ejects is generated.
     Bytes written are printed.

     The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor
     device after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-
     device parameters.  Currently only the lowest of the low
     three bits is interpreted: if it is set, the device is
     treated as having a 64-character set, rather than a full
     96-character set.	In the resulting half-ASCII mode, lower
     case letters are turned into upper case and certain charac-
     ters are escaped according to the following table:

     {	       -(
     }	       -)
     `	       -'
     |	       -!
     ~	       -^

     The driver correctly interprets carriage returns, back-
     spaces, tabs, and form feeds.  Lines longer than the maximum
     page width are truncated.	The default page width is 132
     columns.  This may be overridden by specifying, for example,
     ``flags 256'' .
