     The _t_u interface provides access to the VAX 11/730 and
     11/750 TU58 console cassette drive(s).

     The interface supports only block i/o to the TU58 cassettes.
     The devices are normally manipulated with the _a_r_f_f(8V) pro-
     gram using the ``f'' and ``m'' options.

     The device driver is automatically included when a system is
     configured to run on an 11/730 or 11/750.

     The TU58 on an 11/750 uses the Radial Serial Protocol (RSP)
     to communicate with the cpu over a serial line.  This proto-
     col is inherently unreliable as it has no flow control meas-
     ures built in.  On an 11/730 the Modified Radial Serial Pro-
     tocol is used.  This protocol incorporates flow control
     measures which insure reliable data transfer between the cpu
     and the device.  Certain 11/750's have been modified to use
     the MRSP prom used in the 11/730.	To reliably use the con-
     sole TU58 on an 11/750 under UNIX, the MRSP prom is
     required.	For those 11/750's without an MRSP prom, an
     unreliable but often useable interface has been developed.
     This interface uses an assembly language ``pseudo-dma'' rou-
     tine to minimize the receiver interrupt service latency.  To
     include this code in the system, the configuration must nnoott
     specify the system will run on an 11/730 or use an MRSP
     prom.  This unfortunately makes it impossible to configure a
     single system which will properly handle TU58's on both an
     11/750 and an 11/730 (unless both machines have MRSP proms).

     detected no interrupt for an extended period while an opera-
     tion was outstanding.  This usually indicates that one or
     more receiver interrupts were lost and the transfer is res-
     tarted (11/750 only).

     is shown in octal. No retries are attempted by the driver.

BBUUGGSS
     The VAX-11/750 console interface without MRSP prom is unuse-
     able while the system is multi-user; it should be used only
     with the system running single-user and, even then, with
     caution.
