     fl - console floppy interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a simple interface to the DEC RX01 floppy disk unit,
     which is part of the console LSI-11 subsystem for VAX-
     11/780's.	Access is given to the entire floppy consisting
     of 77 tracks of 26 sectors of 128 bytes.

     All i/o is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should
     be a multiple of 128 bytes and a multiple of 128 bytes
     should be transferred, as in other ``raw'' disk interfaces.

     None.

     Multiple console floppies are not supported.

     If a write is given with a count not a multiple of 128 bytes
     then the trailing portion of the last sector will be zeroed.
