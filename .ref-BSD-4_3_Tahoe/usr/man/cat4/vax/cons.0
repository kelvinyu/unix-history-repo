     cons - VAX-11 console interface

     The console is available to the processor through the con-
     sole registers.  It acts like a normal terminal, except that
     when the local functions are not disabled, control-P puts
     the console in local console mode (where the prompt is
     ``>>>'').	The operation of the console in this mode varies
     slightly per-processor.

     On an 11/780 or 785 the processor is not stopped by entering
     local console mode.  The CPU may be halted with the ``halt''
     command, which may be abbreviated to ``h.'' Conversational
     mode is re-entered by using the command ``set t p'' (set
     terminal program) if the processor is still running, or
     ``continue'' if it is halted.  The latter command may be
     abbreviated ``c''.  If you hit the break key on the console,
     then the console LSI-11 will go into ODT (console debugger
     mode).  Hit a ``P'' (upper-case letter p; ``proceed'') to
     get out of this mode.

     On an 11/750 or an 11/730 the processor is halted whenever
     the console is not in conversational mode, and typing ``C''
     returns to conversational mode.  When in console mode on an
     11/750 which has a remote diagnosis module, a ^D will put
     you in remote diagnosis mode, where the prompt will be
     ``RDM>''.	The command ``ret'' will return from remote diag-
     nosis mode to local console mode.

     The VAX 8600 (8650) console normally works in the same way
     as the 11/750, except that there are many additional modes
     and commands.  In the normal mode control-P halts the pro-
     cessor, and ``c'' or ``continue'' returns to conversational
     mode.  If HEX debug is enabled, control-P does not halt the
     CPU; the ``halt'' command stops the CPU as on the 11/780.

     With the above proviso's the console works like any other
     UNIX terminal.
