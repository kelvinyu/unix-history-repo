     This provides an interface to a Graphic Systems C/A/T photo-
     typesetter or an Autologic APS-Micro5 using a DR11C inter-
     face.  Bytes written on the file specify font, size, and
     other control information as well as the characters to be
     flashed.  The coding is not described here.

     Only one process may have this file open at a time.  It is
     write-only.
