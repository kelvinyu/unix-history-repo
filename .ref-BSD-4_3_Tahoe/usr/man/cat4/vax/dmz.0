     The _d_m_z device provides 24 lines of asynchronous serial line
     support.  Modem control on all ports is available as an
     option for the H3014 distribution panel.

     Each line attached to a DMZ-32 serial line port behaves as
     described in _t_t_y(4).  Input and output for each line may
     independently be set to run at any of 16 speeds; see _t_t_y(4)
     for the encoding.

     Bit _i of flags may be specified for a _d_m_z to to say that a
     line is not properly connected, and that the line should be
     treated as hard-wired with carrier always present.  Thus
     specifying ``flags 0x000004'' in the specification of _d_m_z0
     would cause line _t_t_y_a_2 to be treated in this way.

     The _d_m_z driver normally enables the input silos with a short
     timeout (30 milliseconds); this allows multiple characters
     to be received per interrupt during periods of high-speed
     input.

     ddmmzz%%dd:: NNXXMM lliinnee %%dd.  No response from the UNIBUS on a DMA
     transfer within a timeout period.	This is often followed by
     a UNIBUS adapter error.  This occurs most frequently when
     the UNIBUS is heavily loaded and when devices which hog the
     bus (such as RK07s) are present.  It is not serious.

     ddmmzz%%dd:: ssiilloo oovveerrffllooww.  The character input silo overflowed
     before it could be serviced.  This can happen if a hard
     error occurs when the CPU is running with elevated priority,
     as the system will then print a message on the console with
     interrupts disabled.  It is not serious.

     It should be possible to set the silo timeout with a confi-
     guration file option, as the value is a trade-off between
     efficiency and response time for flow control and character
