     This is a generic UNIBUS storage module disk driver.  It is
     specifically designed to work with the Emulex SC-21 and SC-
     31 controllers.  It can be easily adapted to other controll-
     ers (although bootstrapping will not necessarily be directly
     possible.)

     Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various
     portions of drive 0; minor devices 8 through 15 refer to
     drive 1, etc.  The standard device names begin with ``up''
     followed by the drive number and then a letter a-h for par-
     titions 0-7 respectively.	The character ? stands here for a
     drive number in the range 0-7.

     The block files access the disk via the system's normal
     buffering mechanism and may be read and written without
     regard to physical disk records.  There is also a `raw'
     interface which provides for direct transmission between the
     disk and the user's read or write buffer.	A single read or
     write call results in exactly one I/O operation and there-
     fore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when many words
     are transmitted.  The names of the raw files conventionally
     begin with an extra `r.'

     In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk
     sector).  Likewise _s_e_e_k calls should specify a multiple of
     512 bytes.

     The driver interrogates the controller's holding register to
     determine the type of drive attached.  The driver recognizes
     seven different drives: CDC 9762, CDC 9766, AMPEX DM980,
     AMPEX 9300, AMPEX Capricorn, FUJITSU 160, and FUJITSU Eagle
     (the Eagle is not supported by the SC-21).  The origin and
     size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are as follows:

     It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one
     installation, since there is overlap in addresses and pro-
     tection becomes a sticky matter.  The up?a partition is nor-
     mally used for the root file system, the up?b partition as a
     paging area, and the up?c partition for pack-pack copying
     (it maps the entire disk).  On 160M drives the up?g parti-
     tion maps the rest of the pack.  On other drives both up?g
     and up?h are used to map the remaining cylinders.

     partition.  This happens normally a few times a week.  If it
     happens more frequently than this the sectors where the
     errors are occurring should be checked to see if certain
     cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive or
     heads are indicated.

     detecting no interrupt for an extended period while an
     operation was outstanding.  This indicates a hardware or
     software failure.	There is currently a hardware/software
     problem with spinning down drives while they are being
     accessed which causes this error to occur.  The error causes
     a UNIBUS reset, and retry of the pending operations.  If the
     controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will
     recur a few seconds later.

     In raw I/O _r_e_a_d and _w_r_i_t_e(2) truncate file offsets to 512-
     byte block boundaries, and _w_r_i_t_e scribbles on the tail of
     incomplete blocks.  Thus, in programs that are likely to
     access raw devices, _r_e_a_d, _w_r_i_t_e and _l_s_e_e_k(2) should always
     deal in 512-byte multiples.

     A program to analyze the logged error information (even in
     its present reduced form) is needed.

     The partition tables for the file systems should be read off
     of each pack, as they are never quite what any single
     installation would prefer, and this would make packs more
     portable.
