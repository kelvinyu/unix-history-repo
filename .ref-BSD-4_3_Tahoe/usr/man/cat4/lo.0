     The _l_o_o_p interface is a software loopback mechanism which
     may be used for performance analysis, software testing,
     and/or local communication.  As with other network inter-
     faces, the loopback interface must have network addresses
     assigned for each address family with which it is to be
     used.  These addresses may be set or changed with the SIOC-
     SIFADDR ioctl.  The loopback interface should be the last
     interface configured, as protocols may use the order of con-
     figuration as an indication of priority.  The loopback
     should nneevveerr be configured first unless no hardware inter-
     faces exist.

     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     Previous versions of the system enabled the loopback inter-
     face automatically, using a nonstandard Internet address
     (127.1).  Use of that address is now discouraged; a reserved
     host address for the local network should be used instead.
