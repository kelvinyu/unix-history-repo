     The Cipher F880, M990/Tapemaster combination provides a
     standard tape drive interface as described in _m_t(4).  The
     Cipher F880 tape drive operates at 1600 or 3200 bpi - con-
     trolled by a switch on the drive. The Cipher M990 operates
     at 1600, 3200 or 6250 bpi - controlled by switches on the
     front of the drive.

     The Tapemaster controller board is actually a Multibus con-
     troller accessed through a Halversa Multibus to VERSAbus
     converter card.

     The controller supports only 20-bit addresses.  The only way
     the system can insure the controller will be able to address
     data to be transferred is to copy it into an intermediate
     buffer allocated in the first megabyte of system memory.
