     intro - introduction to special files and hardware support

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section describes the special files, related driver
     functions, and networking support available in the system.
     In this part of the manual, the SYNOPSIS section of each
     configurable device gives a sample specification for use in
     constructing a system description for the _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program.
     The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on
     the console and in the system error log /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
     due to errors in device operation.

     This section contains both devices which may be configured
     into the system, ``4'' entries, and network related informa-
     tion, ``4N'', ``4P'', and ``4F'' entries; The networking
     support is introduced in _i_n_t_r_o(4N).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configura-
     tion time and the appropriate device or network interface
     driver is then compiled into the system.  When the resultant
     system is booted, the autoconfiguration facilities in the
     system probe for the device on the VERSAbus and, if found,
     enable the software support for it.  If a VERSAbus device
     does not respond at autoconfiguration time it is not acces-
     sible at any time afterwards.  To enable a VERSAbus device
     which did not autoconfigure, the system will have to be
     rebooted.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f(4).

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation
     of the system.  Devices are indicated by their functional
     interface.  If second vendor products provide functionally
     identical interfaces they should be usable with the supplied
     software.	(BBeewwaarree hhoowweevveerr tthhaatt wwee pprroommiissee tthhee ssooffttwwaarree
