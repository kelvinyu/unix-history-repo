     The _a_c_e interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through an ACC controller.

     The hardware has 32 kilobytes of dual-ported memory on the
     VERSAbus. This memory is used for internal buffering by the
     board, and the interface code reads the buffer contents
     directly through the VERSAbus.  The address of this memory
     is given in the _f_l_a_g_s field in the configuration file.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _a_c_e interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     The device implements an exponential backoff algorithm when
     notified of a collision on the cable.  This algorithm util-
     izes a table of random numbers setup by the system at boot
     time.  The delay is done in the controller.

     The hardware is not capable of talking to itself.	The
     software implements local sending and broadcast by sending
     such packets to the loop interface.  This is a kludge.

     The device doesn't autoconfigure its interrupt vector; it is
     set at 0x90 + eight times the unit number.
