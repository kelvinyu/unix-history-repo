     split - split a file into pieces

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _S_p_l_i_t reads _f_i_l_e and writes it in _n-line pieces or in
     _b_y_t_e__c_n_t byte pieces to a set of output files.  The default
     is in 1000 line pieces.  The name of the first output file
     is _n_a_m_e with "aa" appended, and so on, lexicographically, to
     "zz".  If no output name is given, "x" is the default, in
     which case _s_p_l_i_t will create files from "xaa" to "zzz".

     If no input file is given, or if -- is given in its stead,
     then the standard input file is used.

BBUUGGSS
     If you provide _n_a_m_e, _s_p_l_i_t can only create 676 separate
     files.  The default naming convention allows 2028 separate
     files.
