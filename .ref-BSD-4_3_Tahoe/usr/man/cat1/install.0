     The file(s) are moved (or copied if the --cc option is speci-
     fied) to the target file or directory.  If the destination
     is a directory, then the _f_i_l_e is moved into _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y with
     its original file-name.  If the target file already exists,
     it is overwritten.

     The mode is set to 755; the --mm option may be used to specify
     an alternate mode.

     The --oo and --gg options may be used to specify an owner and/or
     group, respectively.

     The --ss option causes the file to be stripped.  It is an
     error to attempt to strip a file not in the _a._o_u_t format,
     but not to attempt to strip a file that has already been
     stripped.

     _I_n_s_t_a_l_l refuses to move a file onto itself.

     Installing ``/dev/null'' creates an empty file.
