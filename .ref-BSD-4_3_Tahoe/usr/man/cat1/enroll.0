     These commands implement a secure communication channel; it
     is like _m_a_i_l(1), but no one can read the messages except the
     intended recipient.  The method embodies a public-key cryp-
     tosystem using knapsacks.

     To receive messages, use _e_n_r_o_l_l; it asks you for a password
     that you must subsequently quote in order to receive secret
     mail.

     To receive secret mail, use _x_g_e_t.	It asks for your pass-
     word, then gives you the messages.

     To send secret mail, use _x_s_e_n_d in the same manner as the
     ordinary mail command.  (However, it will accept only one
     target).  A message announcing the receipt of secret mail is
     also sent by ordinary mail.

BBUUGGSS
     It should be integrated with ordinary mail.  The announce-
     ment of secret mail makes traffic analysis possible.
