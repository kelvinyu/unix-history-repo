     _V_l_p formats the named files so that they can be run through
     nroff, vtroff, or troff to produce listings that line-up and
     are attractive.  The first non-blank character of each line
     is lined-up vertically, as in the source file.  Comments
     (text beginning with a semicolon) are printed in italics.
     Each function's name is printed in bold face next to the
     function.	This format makes Lisp code look attractive when
     it is printed with a variable width font.

     Normally, _v_l_p works as a filter and sends its output to the
     standard output.  However, the --vv switch pipes the output
     directly to vtroff.  If no files are specified, then _v_l_p
     reads from the standard input.

     The following options are available:

     --pp   The --pp switch changes the size of the text from its
	  default value of 8 points to one of 6, 8, 10, or 12
	  points.  Once set, the point size is used for all sub-
	  sequent files.  This point size does not apply to
	  embedded text (see -_f below).

     --dd   The --dd switch puts _v_l_p into debugging mode.

     --ff   _V_l_p has a filtered mode in which all lines are passed
	  unmodified, except those lines between the directives
	  ..LLss and ..LLee.	This mode can be used to format Lisp code
	  that is embedded in a document.  The directive ..LLss
	  takes an optional argument that gives the point size
	  for the embedded code.  If not size is specified, the
	  size of the surrounding text is used.

     --ll   The --ll switch prevents _v_l_p from placing labels next to
	  functions.  This switch is useful for embedded Lisp
	  code, where the labels would be distracting.

     --vv   This switch cause _v_l_p to send its output to vtroff
	  rather than the standard output.

     --TT   A title to be printed on each page may be specified by
	  using the --TT switch.	The --TT switch applies only to the
	  next file name given.  Titles are not printed for
	  embedded text (see --ff, above).  This switch may not be

     _v_l_p transforms \ into \\ so that it will be printed out.
     Hence, troff commands cannot be embedded in Lisp code.
