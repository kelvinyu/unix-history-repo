     The _g_r_o_u_p_s command shows the groups to which you or the
     optionally specified user belong.	Each user belongs to a
     group specified in the password file /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d and possi-
     bly to other groups as specified in the file /_e_t_c/_g_r_o_u_p.  If
     you do not own a file but belong to the group which it is
     owned by then you are granted group access to the file.

     When a new file is created it is given the group of the con-
     taining directory.
