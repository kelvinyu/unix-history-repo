     _P_c is a Pascal compiler.  If given an argument file ending
     with ..pp, it will compile the file and load it into an exe-
     cutable file called, by default, _a._o_u_t.

     A program may be separated into more than one ..pp file.  _P_c
     will compile a number of argument ..pp files into object files
     (with the extension ..oo in place of ..pp).  Object files may
     then be loaded into an executable _a._o_u_t file.  Exactly one
     object file must supply a pprrooggrraamm statement to successfully
     create an executable a.out file.  The rest of the files must
     consist only of declarations which logically nest within the
     program.  References to objects shared between separately
     compiled files are allowed if the objects are declared in
     iinncclluuddeed header files, whose names must end with ..hh.  Header
     files may only be included at the outermost level, and thus
     declare only globally available objects.  To allow ffuunnccttiioonns
     and pprroocceedduurrees to be declared, an eexxtteerrnnaall directive has
     been added, whose use is similar to the ffoorrwwaarrdd directive
     but restricted to appear only in ..hh files.  FFuunnccttiioonn and
     pprroocceedduurree bodies may not appear in ..hh files.  A binding
     phase of the compiler checks that declarations are used con-
     sistently, to enforce the type checking rules of Pascal.

     Object files created by other language processors may be
     loaded together with object files created by _p_c.  The ffuunncc--
     ttiioonns and pprroocceedduurrees they define must have been declared in
     ..hh files included by all the ..pp files which call those rou-
     tines.  Calling conventions are as in C, with vvaarr parameters
     passed by address.

     See the Berkeley Pascal User's Manual for details.

     The following options have the same meaning as in _c_c(1) and
     _f_7_7(1).  See _l_d(1) for load-time options.

     --cc    Suppress loading and produce `.o' file(s) from source
	   file(s).

     --gg    Have the compiler produce additional symbol table
	   information for _d_b_x(1).

     --ww    Suppress warning messages.

     --pp    Prepare object files for profiling, see _p_r_o_f(1).

     --OO    Invoke an object-code improver.

     --SS    Compile the named program, and leave the assembler-
	   language output on the corresponding file suffixed
	   `.s'.  (No `.o' is created.).

     --oo output
	   Name the final output file _o_u_t_p_u_t instead of _a._o_u_t.

     The following options are peculiar to _p_c.

     --CC    Compile code to perform runtime checks, verify aasssseerrtt
	   calls, and initialize all variables to zero as in _p_i.

     --bb    Block buffer the file _o_u_t_p_u_t.

     --ii    Produce a listing for the specified procedures, func-
	   tions and iinncclluuddee files.

     --ll    Make a program listing during translation.

     --ss    Accept standard Pascal only; non-standard constructs
	   cause warning diagnostics.

     --tt directory
	   Use the given _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y for compiler temporary files.

     --zz    Allow execution profiling with _p_x_p by generating
	   statement counters, and arranging for the creation of
	   the profile data file _p_m_o_n._o_u_t when the resulting
	   object is executed.

     Other arguments are taken to be loader option arguments,
     perhaps libraries of _p_c compatible routines.  Certain flags
     can also be controlled in comments within the program as
     described in the _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _P_a_s_c_a_l _U_s_e_r'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l.

BBUUGGSS
     The keyword ppaacckkeedd is recognized but has no effect.

     The binder is not as strict as described here, with regard
     to the rules about external declarations only in `.h' files
     and including `.h' files only at the outermost level.  It
     will be made to perform these checks in its next incarna-
     tion, so users are warned not to be sloppy.

     The --zz flag doesn't work for separately compiled files.

     Because the --ss option is usurped by the compiler, it is not
     possible to pass the strip option to the loader.  Thus pro-
     grams which are to be stripped, must be run through _s_t_r_i_p(1)
     after they are compiled.
