     _A_p_r_o_p_o_s shows which manual pages contain instances of any of
     the given _k_e_y_w_o_r_d(s) in their title line.	Each word is con-
     sidered separately and case of letters is ignored.  Words
     which are part of other words are considered; when looking
     for compile, _a_p_r_o_p_o_s will also find all instances of ``com-
     piler''.

     If the line output by _a_p_r_o_p_o_s starts ``name(section) ...''
     you can enter ``man section name'' to get its documentation.

     Normally _a_p_r_o_p_o_s checks in a standard location (/usr/man)
     for its database ``whatis''.  This can be changed by supply-
     ing a _p_a_t_h (a la the Bourne shell) with the --MM flag.  This
     search path must be a colon (``:'') separated list of direc-
     tories which _a_p_r_o_p_o_s will search for files named ``whatis''.
     The path can also be set with the environmental variable
     _M_A_N_P_A_T_H.
