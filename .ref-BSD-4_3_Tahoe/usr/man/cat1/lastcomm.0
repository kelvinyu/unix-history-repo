     _L_a_s_t_c_o_m_m gives information on previously executed commands.
     With no arguments, _l_a_s_t_c_o_m_m prints information about all the
     commands recorded during the current accounting file's life-
     time.  The -_f option causes _l_a_s_t_c_o_m_m to read from a file
     other than the default accounting file.  If called with
     arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command
     name, user name, or terminal name are printed.  So, for
     example,
	  lastcomm a.out root ttyd0
     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands
     named _a._o_u_t by user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.
	  The name of the user who ran the process.
	  Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in
	  the system.
	  The command name under which the process was called.
	  The amount of cpu time used by the process (in
	  seconds).
	  The time the process exited.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the com-
     mand was executed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the
     command ran after a fork, but without a following _e_x_e_c,
     ``C'' indicates the command was run in PDP-11 compatibility
     mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command terminated with
     the generation of a _c_o_r_e file, and ``X'' indicates the com-
     mand was terminated with a signal.
