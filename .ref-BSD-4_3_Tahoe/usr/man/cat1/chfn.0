     This command changes (or installs) a password, login shell
     (--ss option), or GECOS information field (--ff option) associ-
     ated with the user _n_a_m_e (your own name by default).

     When altering a password, the program prompts for the
     current password and then for the new one.  The caller must
     supply both.  The new password must be typed twice to fore-
     stall mistakes.

     New passwords must be at least four characters long if they
     use a sufficiently rich alphabet and at least six characters
     long if monocase.	These rules are relaxed if you are
     insistent enough.

     Only the owner of the name or the super-user may change a
     password; the owner must prove he knows the old password.

     When altering a login shell, _p_a_s_s_w_d displays the current
     login shell and then prompts for the new one.  The new login
     shell must be one of the approved shells listed in
     /_e_t_c/_s_h_e_l_l_s unless you are the super-user.  If /_e_t_c/_s_h_e_l_l_s
     does not exist, the only shells that may be specified are
     /_b_i_n/_s_h and /_b_i_n/_c_s_h.

     The super-user may change anyone's login shell; normal users
     may only change their own login shell.

     When altering the GECOS information field, _p_a_s_s_w_d displays
     the current information, broken into fields, as interpreted
     by the _f_i_n_g_e_r(1) program, among others, and prompts for new
     values.  These fields include a user's ``real life'' name,
     office room number, office phone number, and home phone
     number.  Included in each prompt is a default value, which
     is enclosed between brackets.  The default value is accepted
     simply by typing a carriage return.  To enter a blank field,
     the word ``none'' may be typed.  Below is a sample run:

	  NNaammee [[BBiiffff SSttuuddsswwoorrtthh IIII]]::

     _P_a_s_s_w_d allows phone numbers to be entered with or without
     hyphens.  It is a good idea to run _f_i_n_g_e_r after changing the
