     _L_o_c_k requests a password from the user, reads it again for
     verification and then it will normally not relinquish the
     terminal until the password is repeated.  There are three
     other conditions under which it will terminate: it accepts
     the password for root as an alternative to the one given by
     the user, it will timeout after some interval of time, and
     it may be killed by somebody with the appropriate permis-
     sion. The default time limit is 15 minutes but it may be
     changed with the -_n_u_m_b_e_r option where _n_u_m_b_e_r is the time
     limit in minutes.	The -_p option has _l_o_c_k use the user's
     standard password instead of requesting another one.
