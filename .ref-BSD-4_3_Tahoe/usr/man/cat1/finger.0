     finger - user information lookup program

     By default _f_i_n_g_e_r lists the login name, full name, terminal
     name and write status (as a `*' before the terminal name if
     write permission is denied), idle time, login time, and
     office location and phone number (if they are known) for
     each current UNIX user.  (Idle time is minutes if it is a
     single integer, hours and minutes if a ':' is present, or
     days and hours if a 'd' is present.)

     A longer format also exists and is used by _f_i_n_g_e_r whenever a
     list of people's names is given.  (Account names as well as
     first and last names of users are accepted.) This format is
     multi-line, and includes all the information described above
     as well as the user's home directory and login shell, any
     plan which the person has placed in the file ._p_l_a_n in their
     home directory, and the project on which they are working
     from the file ._p_r_o_j_e_c_t also in the home directory.

     _F_i_n_g_e_r may be used to lookup users on a remote machine.  The
     format is to specify the user as ``user@host.''  If the user
     name is left off, the standard format listing is provided on
     the remote machine.

     _F_i_n_g_e_r options include:

     --mm   Match arguments only on user name.

     --ll   Force long output format.

     --pp   Suppress printing of the ._p_l_a_n files

     --ss   Force short output format.

BBUUGGSS
     Only the first line of the ._p_r_o_j_e_c_t file is printed.

     The encoding of the gcos field is UCB dependent - it knows
     that an office `197MC' is `197M Cory Hall', and that `529BE'
     is `529B Evans Hall'.  It also knows that a four digit
     office phone number should have a ``x2-'' prepended.

     There is no way to pass arguments to the remote machine as
     _f_i_n_g_e_r uses an internet standard port.

     A user information data base is in the works and will radi-
     cally alter the way the information that _f_i_n_g_e_r uses is
     stored.  Finger will require extensive modification when
     this is implemented.
