     _L_a_s_t will list the sessions of specified _u_s_e_r_s, _t_t_y_s, and
     _h_o_s_t_s, in reverse time order.  Each line of output contains
     the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted,
     any hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and
     the duration of the session.  If the session is still con-
     tinuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, _l_a_s_t will
     so indicate.

     _L_a_s_t reads the file _f_i_l_e, or by default, /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_w_t_m_p.  The
     --## option limits the report to ## lines.

     Other arguments specify _u_s_e_r_s, _t_t_y_s or _h_o_s_t_s of interest.
     Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, e.g., ``last -t
     03'' is equivalent to ``last -t tty03''.  Host names may be
     internet numbers.	If multiple arguments are given, the
     information which applies to any of the arguments is
     printed, e.g., ``last root -t console'' would list all of
     ``root's'' sessions as well as all sessions on the console
     terminal. If no users, hostnames or terminals are specified,
     _l_a_s_t prints a record of all logins and logouts.

     The pseudo-user rreebboooott logs in at reboots of the system,
     thus ``last reboot'' will give an indication of mean time
     between reboot.

     If _l_a_s_t is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search
     has progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal _l_a_s_t
     indicates how far the search has progressed and then contin-
     ues.
