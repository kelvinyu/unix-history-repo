     _W prints a summary of the current activity on the system,
     including what each user is doing.  The heading line shows
     the current time of day, how long the system has been up,
     the number of users logged into the system, and the load
     averages.	The load average numbers give the number of jobs
     in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

     The fields output are: the users login name, the name of the
     tty the user is on, the host from which the user is logged
     in, the time the user logged on, the time since the user
     last typed anything, the CPU time used by all processes and
     their children on that terminal, the CPU time used by the
     currently active processes, the name and arguments of the
     current process.

     The --hh flag suppresses the heading.  The --ss flag asks for a
     short form of output.  In the short form, the tty is abbre-
     viated, the login time and cpu times are left off, as are
     the arguments to commands.  --ll gives the long output, which
     is the default.  The --ff option suppresses the ``from''
     field.

     If a _u_s_e_r name is included, the output will be restricted to
     that user.

     The notion of the ``current process'' is muddy.  The current
     algorithm is ``the highest numbered process on the terminal
     that is not ignoring interrupts, or, if there is none, the
     highest numbered process on the terminal''.  This fails, for
     example, in critical sections of programs like the shell and
     editor, or when faulty programs running in the background
     fork and fail to ignore interrupts.  (In cases where no pro-
     cess can be found, _w prints ``-''.)

     The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone
     leaves a background process running after logging out, the
     person currently on that terminal is ``charged'' with the
     time.

     Background processes are not shown, even though they account
     for much of the load on the system.

     Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are
     printed with null or garbaged arguments.  In these cases,
     the name of the command is printed in parentheses.

     W does not know about the new conventions for detection of
     background jobs.  It will sometimes find a background job
     instead of the right one.
