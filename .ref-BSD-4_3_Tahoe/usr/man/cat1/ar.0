     _A_r maintains groups of files combined into a single archive
     file.  Its main use is to create and update library files as
     used by the loader.  It can be used, though, for any similar
     purpose.  NN..BB:: This version of _a_r uses a ASCII-format
     archive which is portable among the various machines running
     UNIX.  Programs for dealing with older formats are avail-
     able: see _a_r_c_v(8).

     _K_e_y is one character from the set ddrrqqttppmmxx,, optionally con-
     catenated with one or more of vvuuaaiibbcclloo.. _A_f_i_l_e is the archive
     file.  The _n_a_m_e_s are constituent files in the archive file.
     The meanings of the _k_e_y characters are:

     dd	  Delete the named files from the archive file.

     rr	  Replace the named files in the archive file.	If the
	  optional character uu is used with rr,, then only those
	  files with `last-modified' dates later than the archive
	  files are replaced.  If an optional positioning charac-
	  ter from the set aabbii is used, then the _p_o_s_n_a_m_e argument
	  must be present and specifies that new files are to be
	  placed after (aa) or before (bb or ii) _p_o_s_n_a_m_e.	Otherwise
	  new files are placed at the end.

     qq	  Quickly append the named files to the end of the
	  archive file.  Optional positioning characters are
	  invalid.  The command does not check whether the added
	  members are already in the archive.  Useful only to
	  avoid quadratic behavior when creating a large archive
	  piece-by-piece.

     tt	  Print a table of contents of the archive file.  If no
	  names are given, all files in the archive are tabled.
	  If names are given, only those files are tabled.

     pp	  Print the named files in the archive.

     mm	  Move the named files to the end of the archive.  If a
	  positioning character is present, then the _p_o_s_n_a_m_e
	  argument must be present and, as in rr,, specifies where
	  the files are to be moved.

     xx	  Extract the named files.  If no names are given, all
	  files in the archive are extracted.  In neither case
	  does xx alter the archive file. Normally the `last-

	  modified' date of each extracted file is the date when
	  it is extracted. However, if oo is used, the `last-
	  modified' date is reset to the date recorded in the
	  archive.

     vv	  Verbose.  Under the verbose option, _a_r gives a file-
	  by-file description of the making of a new archive file
	  from the old archive and the constituent files.  When
	  used with tt,, it gives a long listing of all information
	  about the files.  When used with pp, it precedes each
	  file with a name.

     cc	  Create.  Normally _a_r will create _a_f_i_l_e when it needs
	  to.  The create option suppresses the normal message
	  that is produced when _a_f_i_l_e is created.

     ll	  Local.  Normally _a_r places its temporary files in the
	  directory /tmp.  This option causes them to be placed
	  in the local directory.

BBUUGGSS
     If the same file is mentioned twice in an argument list, it
     may be put in the archive twice.

     The `last-modified' date of a file will not be altered by
     the oo option if the user is not the owner of the extracted
     file, or the super-user.
