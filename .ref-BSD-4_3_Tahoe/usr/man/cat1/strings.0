     _S_t_r_i_n_g_s looks for ascii strings in each of the specified
     files, or from the standard input.  A string is any sequence
     of 4 or more printing characters.	Unless the --aa flag is
     given, _s_t_r_i_n_g_s only looks in the initialized data space of
     object files.  If the --oo flag is given, then each string is
     preceded by its decimal offset in the file.  If the --_n_u_m_b_e_r
     flag is given, then _n_u_m_b_e_r is used as the minimum string
     length rather than 4.

     _S_t_r_i_n_g_s is useful for identifying random object files and
     many other things.
