     cmp - compare two files

     The two files are compared.  (If _f_i_l_e_1 is `-', the standard
     input is used.)  With no options, _c_m_p makes no comment if
     the files are the same; if they differ, it reports the byte
     and line number at which the difference occurred, or, that
     one file is an initial subsequence of the other.  _S_k_i_p_1 and
     _s_k_i_p_2 are initial byte offsets into _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 respec-
     tively, and may be either octal or decimal; a leading ``0''
     denotes octal.

     Options:

     --ss    Print nothing for differing files; set exit codes
	   only.

     --ll    Print the byte number (in decimal) and the differing
	   bytes (in octal) for all differences between the two
	   files.

     Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different
     files, and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument, or a
     system error.
