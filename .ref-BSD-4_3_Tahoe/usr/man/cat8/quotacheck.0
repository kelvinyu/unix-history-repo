     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k examines each file system, builds a table of
     current disc usage, and compares this table against that
     stored in the disc quota file for the file system.  If any
     inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file and the
     current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the
     latter only occurs if an active file system is checked).

     If the --aa flag is supplied in place of any file system
     names, _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will check all the file systems indicated
     in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b to be read-write with disc quotas.

     Normally _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k reports only those quotas modified.  If
     the --vv option is supplied, _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will indicate the cal-
     culated disc quotas for each user on a particular file sys-
     tem.

     If the --pp flag is supplied then parallel passes will be run
     on the filesystems required, using the pass numbers in
     /etc/fstab in an identical fashion to _f_s_c_k(8).

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k expects each file system to be checked to have a
     quota file named _q_u_o_t_a_s in the root directory.  If none is
     present, _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will ignore the file system.

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k is normally run at boot time from the
     /_e_t_c/_r_c._l_o_c_a_l file, see _r_c(8), before enabling disc quotas
     with _q_u_o_t_a_o_n(8).

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
     disc usage for each user.	Thus, the file systems checked
     should be quiescent while _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k is running.
