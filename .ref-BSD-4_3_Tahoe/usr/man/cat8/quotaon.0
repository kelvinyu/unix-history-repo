     _Q_u_o_t_a_o_n announces to the system that disc quotas should be
     enabled on one or more file systems.  The file systems
     specified must have entries in /etc/fstab and be mounted at
     the time.	The file system quota files must be present in
     the root directory of the specified file system and be named
     _q_u_o_t_a_s.  The optional argument --vv causes _q_u_o_t_a_o_n to print a
     message for each file system where quotas are turned on.
     If, instead of a list of file systems, a --aa argument is give
     to _q_u_o_t_a_o_n, all file systems in /etc/fstab marked read-write
     with quotas will have their quotas turned on.  This is nor-
     mally used at boot time to enable quotas.

     _Q_u_o_t_a_o_f_f announces to the system that file systems specified
     should have any disc quotas turned off.  As above, the --vv
     forces a verbose message for each file system affected; and
     the --aa option forces all file systems in /etc/fstab to have
     their quotas disabled.

     These commands update the status field of devices located in
     /_e_t_c/_m_t_a_b to indicate when quotas are on or off for each
     file system.
