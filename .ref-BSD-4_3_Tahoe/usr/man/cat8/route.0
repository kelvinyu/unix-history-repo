DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _R_o_u_t_e is a program used to manually manipulate the network
     routing tables.  It normally is not needed, as the system
     routing table management daemon, _r_o_u_t_e_d(8C), should tend to
     this task.

     _R_o_u_t_e accepts two commands: _a_d_d, to add a route, and _d_e_l_e_t_e,
     to delete a route.

     All commands have the following syntax:

       //eettcc//rroouuttee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ nneett | hhoosstt ] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y [
     _m_e_t_r_i_c ]

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_-
     _w_a_y is the next-hop gateway to which packets should be
     addressed, and _m_e_t_r_i_c is a count indicating the number of
     hops to the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  The metric is required for _a_d_d
     commands; it must be zero if the destination is on a
     directly-attached network, and nonzero if the route utilizes
     one or more gateways.  If adding a route with metric 0, the
     gateway given is the address of this host on the common net-
     work, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.
     Routes to a particular host are distinguished from those to
     a network by interpreting the Internet address associated
     with _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.	The optional keywords nneett and hhoosstt force
     the destination to be interpreted as a network or a host,
     respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has a ``local
     address part'' of INADDR_ANY, or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the
     symbolic name of a network, then the route is assumed to be
     to a network; otherwise, it is presumed to be a route to a
     host.  If the route is to a destination connected via a
     gateway, the _m_e_t_r_i_c should be greater than 0.  All symbolic
     names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N).  If this
     lookup fails, _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) is then used to interpret the
     name as that of a network.

     _R_o_u_t_e uses a raw socket and the SIOCADDRT and SIOCDELRT
     _i_o_c_t_l's to do its work.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

     If the --ff option is specified, _r_o_u_t_e will ``flush'' the
     routing tables of all gateway entries.  If this is used in
     conjunction with one of the commands described above, the
     tables are flushed prior to the command's application.

     The --nn option prevents attempts to print host and network
     names symbolically when reporting actions.

     The specified route is being added to the tables.	The
     values printed are from the routing table entry supplied in
     the _i_o_c_t_l call.  If the gateway address used was not the
     primary address of the gateway (the first one returned by
     _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e), the gateway address is printed numerically
     as well as symbolically.

     ``ddeelleettee [[ hhoosstt || nneettwwoorrkk ]] %%ss:: ggaatteewwaayy %%ss ffllaaggss %%xx''
     As above, but when deleting an entry.

     ``%%ss %%ss ddoonnee''
     When the --ff flag is specified, each routing table entry
     deleted is indicated with a message of this form.

     ``NNeettwwoorrkk iiss uunnrreeaacchhaabbllee''
     An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed
     was not on a directly-connected network.  The next-hop gate-
     way must be given.

     ``nnoott iinn ttaabbllee''
     A delete operation was attempted for an entry which wasn't
     present in the tables.

     ``rroouuttiinngg ttaabbllee oovveerrffllooww''
     An add operation was attempted, but the system was low on
     resources and was unable to allocate memory to create the
     new entry.
