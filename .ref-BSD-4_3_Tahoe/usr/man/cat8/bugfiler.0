     _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r is a program to automatically intercept, ack-
     nowledge, redistribute and store bug reports.  _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r is
     normally invoked by the mail delivery program with a line
     similar to the following in /usr/lib/aliases.

	  bugs:     "|bugfiler"

     It should be noted that the login ``bugs'' must exist for
     the bugfiler to run.  Unless otherwise noted all paths used
     by _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r are relative to the home directory of this
     login.  _B_u_g_f_i_l_e_r also expects all of its files and direc-
     tories to be owned by ``bugs''.

     For the bug report to be correctly filed, it must contain a
     line in the following format:

	  Index:    _f_o_l_d_e_r    _v_e_r_s_i_o_n

     The directories ~bugs/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n and ~bugs/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n/_f_o_l_d_e_r must
     exist before _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r attempts to store the bug report.  Bug
     reports will be stored in files named by the concatenation
     of _v_e_r_s_i_o_n, _f_o_l_d_e_r, and sequential numbers, i.e. if _v_e_r_s_i_o_n
     is ``4.3BSD'' and _f_o_l_d_e_r is ``ucb'' the first bug report
     will be placed in ~bugs/4.3BSD/ucb/1.  If _f_o_l_d_e_r contains
     more than one component only the first one will be used,
     e.g. if _f_o_l_d_e_r is ``bin/from.c'' or ``bin/adb/con.c'' it
     will be treated as if it were simply ``bin''.  The -_v flag
     is provided as a means to override the _v_e_r_s_i_o_n provided
     within the bug report itself.

     A mail acknowledgement is automatically sent to the bug
     report filer unless the --aa flag is supplied.  The file
     ~bugs/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n/bug:ack is appended to this acknowledgement.

     If the --rr flag is not supplied, redistribution of the bug
     reports is done as specified in the file
     ~bugs/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n/bug:redist.	This file is in the format of the
     _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(5) file, including comments and entries requiring
     multiple lines, with the single exception that the _f_o_l_d_e_r
     component of the ``Index:'' line replaces the name to alias.
     The special folder ``all:'' receives a redistribution of all
     bug reports sent to this _v_e_r_s_i_o_n.	For example, the
     _b_u_g:_r_e_d_i_s_t file

BUGFILER(8)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      BUGFILER(8)



	  #    bigbug gets a copy of everything
	  all: bigbug
	  #    ucb folder redistribution list
	  ucb: karels, kjd@coke.berkeley.edu
	       ra@beno.css.gov

     will send copies of all bug reports with ``ucb'' as the
     _f_o_l_d_e_r to bigbug, karels, kjd, and ra.

     Reports that cannot be filed, due to an invalid ``Index:''
     line or some other error, are placed in the directory
     ~bugs/errors.  The _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r maintainer should correct these
     bug reports and then run _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r, with the corrected report
     as its standard input, as bug reports with errors are nei-
     ther acknowledged or redistributed.  All reports that _b_u_g_-
     _f_i_l_e_r handles are logged in ~bugs/log.

     Valid bugs are also logged in the file
     ~bugs/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n/summary.  This file has an entry for each bug
     report for _v_e_r_s_i_o_n in the format:

	  Filename	 Date
	       Subject:
	       Index:
	       Owner:	 Bugs Bunny
	       Status:	 Received

     _F_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is the concatenation of _v_e_r_s_i_o_n, _f_o_l_d_e_r, and a
     number as described above.  _D_a_t_e is the date as reported by
     the system clock, using ctime(3).	The _S_u_b_j_e_c_t: and _I_n_d_e_x:
     lines are copies of the ``Subject:'' and ``Index:'' lines
     contained in the bug report.  The _O_w_n_e_r and _S_t_a_t_u_s fields
     are intended to provide a rudimentary method of tracking the
     status of bug reports.

     The file ~bugs/bug:lock is the focus of all locking for _b_u_g_-
     _f_i_l_e_r.  If you wish to manipulate any of the log or error
     files, rename or remove it and _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r will treat all bug
     reports that it receives as if they were incorrectly format-
     ted, i.e. it will place them in the directory ~bugs/errors,
     for later recovery by the _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r maintainer.  Obviously,
     this file must be created when you first install _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r.

     All errors that occur before ~bugs/log is found are logged
     into the system log file, using _s_y_s_l_o_g(8).

     Since mail can be forwarded in a number of different ways,
     _b_u_g_f_i_l_e_r does not recognize forwarded mail and will ack-
     nowledge to the forwarder instead of the original sender
     unless there is a `Reply-To' field in the header.

     This version of the bugfiler is not compatible with the ver-
     sion released with 4.3BSD in that it doesn't complain to the
     sender about incorrectly formatted bug reports.
