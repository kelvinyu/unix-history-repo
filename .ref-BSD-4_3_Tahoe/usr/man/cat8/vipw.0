     _V_i_p_w edits the password file while setting the appropriate
     locks, and does any necessary processing after the password
     file is unlocked.	If the password file is already being
     edited, then you will be told to try again later.	The _v_i
     editor will be used unless the environment variable EDITOR
     indicates an alternate editor. _V_i_p_w performs a number of
     consistency checks on the password entry for _r_o_o_t, and will
     not allow a password file with a ``mangled'' root entry to
     be installed.
