     _H_a_l_t writes out sandbagged information to the disks and then
     stops the processor.  The machine does not reboot, even if
     the auto-reboot switch is set on the console.

     The --nn option prevents the sync before stopping.  The --qq
     option causes a quick halt, no graceful shutdown is
     attempted.  The --yy option is needed if you are trying to
     halt the system from a dialup.

     _H_a_l_t normally logs the shutdown using _s_y_s_l_o_g(8) and places a
     shutdown record in the login accounting file /usr/adm/wtmp.
     These actions are inhibited if the --nn or --qq options are
     present.

BBUUGGSS
     It is very difficult to halt a VAX, as the machine wants to
     then reboot itself.  A rather tight loop suffices.
