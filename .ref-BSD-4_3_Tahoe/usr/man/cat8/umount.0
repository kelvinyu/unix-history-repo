     _M_o_u_n_t announces to the system that a removable file system
     is present on the device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l. The file _n_a_m_e must exist
     already; it must be a directory (unless the root of the
     mounted file system is not a directory).  It becomes the
     name of the newly mounted root.  The optional argument --rr
     indicates that the file system is to be mounted read-only.

     _U_m_o_u_n_t announces to the system that the removable file sys-
     tem previously mounted on device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is to be removed.

     If the --aa option is present for either _m_o_u_n_t or _u_m_o_u_n_t, all
     of the file systems described in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b are attempted to
     be mounted or unmounted.  In this case, _s_p_e_c_i_a_l and _n_a_m_e are
     taken from /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b. The _s_p_e_c_i_a_l file name from /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b
     is the block special name.

     These commands maintain a table of mounted devices in
     /_e_t_c/_m_t_a_b. If invoked without an argument, _m_o_u_n_t prints the
     table.

     Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file systems
     must be mounted read-only or errors will occur when access
     times are updated, whether or not any explicit write is
     attempted.

BBUUGGSS
     Mounting file systems full of garbage will crash the system.
     Mounting a root directory on a non-directory makes some
     apparently good pathnames invalid.
