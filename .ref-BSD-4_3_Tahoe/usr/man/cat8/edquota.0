     _E_d_q_u_o_t_a is a quota editor.  One or more users may be speci-
     fied on the command line.	For each user a temporary file is
     created with an ASCII representation of the current disc
     quotas for that user and an editor is then invoked on the
     file.  The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added,
     etc.  Upon leaving the editor, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a reads the temporary
     file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the
     changes made.

     If the --pp option is specified, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a will duplicate the
     quotas of the prototypical user specified for each user
     specified.  This is the normal mechanism used to initialize
     quotas for groups of users.

     The editor invoked is _v_i(1) unless the environment variable
     EDITOR specifies otherwise.

     Only the super-user may edit quotas.
