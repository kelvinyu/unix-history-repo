     _T_f_t_p_d is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File
     Transfer Protocol.  The TFTP server operates at the port
     indicated in the ``tftp'' service description; see _s_e_r_-
     _v_i_c_e_s(5).	The server is normally started by _i_n_e_t_d(8).

     The use of _t_f_t_p does not require an account or password on
     the remote system.  Due to the lack of authentication infor-
     mation, _t_f_t_p_d will allow only publicly readable files to be
     accessed.	Files may be written only if they already exist
     and are publicly writable.  Note that this extends the con-
     cept of ``public'' to include all users on all hosts that
     can be reached through the network; this may not be
     appropriate on all systems, and its implications should be
     considered before enabling tftp service.  The server should
     have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.
