     _S_y_n_c executes the _s_y_n_c system primitive.  _S_y_n_c can be called
     to insure that all disk writes have been completed before
     the processor is halted in a way not suitably done by
     _r_e_b_o_o_t(8) or _h_a_l_t(8).  Generally, it is preferable to use
     _r_e_b_o_o_t or _h_a_l_t to shut down the system, as they may perform
     additional actions such as resynchronizing the hardware
     clock and flushing internal caches before performing a final
     _s_y_n_c.

     See _s_y_n_c(2) for details on the system primitive.
