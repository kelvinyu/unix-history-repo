     The _s_h_e_l_l_s file contains a list of the shells on the system.
     For each shell a single line should be present consisting of
     the shell's path, relative to root.

     A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent
     characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by
     the routines which search the file.  Blank lines are also
     ignored.
