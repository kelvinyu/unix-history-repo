     The _u_t_m_p file records information about who is currently
     using the system.	The file is a sequence of entries with
     the following structure declared in the include file:

	  /*
	   * Copyright (c) 1980 Regents of the University of California.
	   * All rights reserved.  The Berkeley software License Agreement
	   * specifies the terms and conditions for redistribution.
	   *
	   *   @(#)utmp.h     5.1 (Berkeley) 5/30/85
	   */

	  /*
	   * Structure of utmp and wtmp files.
	   *
	   * Assuming the number 8 is unwise.
	   */
	  struct utmp {
	       char ut_line[8];         /* tty name */
	       char ut_name[8];         /* user id */
	       char ut_host[16];	/* host name, if remote */
	       long ut_time;	   /* time on */
	  };

     This structure gives the name of the special file associated
     with the user's terminal, the user's login name, and the
     time of the login in the form of _t_i_m_e(3C).

     The _w_t_m_p file records all logins and logouts.  A null user
     name indicates a logout on the associated terminal.  Furth-
     ermore, the terminal name `~' indicates that the system was
     rebooted at the indicated time; the adjacent pair of entries
     with terminal names `|' and `{' indicate the system-
     maintained time just before and just after a _d_a_t_e command
     has changed the system's idea of the time.

     _W_t_m_p is maintained by _l_o_g_i_n(1) and _i_n_i_t(8).  Neither of
     these programs creates the file, so if it is removed
     record-keeping is turned off.  It is summarized by _a_c(8).
