     passwd - password file

     _P_a_s_s_w_d contains for each user the following information:

     name (login name, contains no upper case)
     encrypted password
     numerical user ID
     numerical group ID
     user's real name, office, extension, home phone.
     initial working directory
     program to use as Shell

     The name may contain `&', meaning insert the login name.
     This information is set by the _c_h_f_n(1) command and used by
     the _f_i_n_g_e_r(1) command.

     This is an ASCII file.  Each field within each user's entry
     is separated from the next by a colon.  Each user is
     separated from the next by a new-line.  If the password
     field is null, no password is demanded; if the Shell field
     is null, then /_b_i_n/_s_h is used.

     This file resides in directory /etc.  Because of the
     encrypted passwords, it can and does have general read per-
     mission and can be used, for example, to map numerical user
     ID's to names.

     Appropriate precautions must be taken to lock the file
     against changes if it is to be edited with a text editor;
     _v_i_p_w(8) does the necessary locking.

     User information (name, office, etc.) should be stored else-
     where.
