.TH ACCT 2 2/13/82
.SH NAME
acct \- turn accounting on or off
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
acct(file)
char *file;
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The system is prepared to write a record
in an accounting
.I file
for each process as it terminates.
This
call, with a null-terminated string naming an existing file
as argument, turns on accounting;
records for each terminating process are appended to
.IR file .
An argument of 0 causes accounting to be turned off.
.PP
The accounting file format is given in
.IR acct (5).
.SH NOTES
Accounting is automatically turned off when the file system the
accounting file resides on runs out of space; it is not, however
turned back on when space becomes available.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On error \-1 is returned.
The file must exist and the call may be exercised only by the super-user.
It is erroneous to try to turn on accounting when it is already on.
.SH ERRORS
To be supplied.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
acct(5), sa(8)
.SH BUGS
No accounting is produced for programs running
when a crash occurs.
In particular nonterminating programs are never
accounted for.
