.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Psignal
produces a short message
on the standard error file
describing the indicated signal.
First the argument string
.I s
is printed, then a colon, then the name of the signal
and a new-line.
Most usefully, the argument string is the name
of the program which incurred the signal.
The signal number should be from among those found
in
.IR <signal.h> .
.PP
To simplify variant formatting
of signal names, the vector of message strings
.I sys_siglist
is provided;
the signal number
can be used as an index in this table to get the
signal name without the newline.
The define NSIG defined in
.RI < signal.h >
is the number of messages provided for in the table;
it should be checked because new
signals may be added to the system before
they are added to the table.
