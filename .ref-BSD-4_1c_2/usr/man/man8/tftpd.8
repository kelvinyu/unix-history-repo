tftp \- DARPA Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS

.I port
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tftpd
is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File Transfer
Protocol.  The TFTP server operates
at the port indicated in the ``tftp'' service description;
see
.IR services (5).
This port number may be overridden (for debugging purposes)
by specifying a port number on the command line.  If the
.B \-d
option is specified, each socket created by
.I tftpd
will have debugging enabled (see SO_DEBUG in
.IR socket (2)).
.PP
Due to the lack of authentication information, 
.I tftpd
will allow only publicly readable files to be
accessed.

.SH BUGS
This server is known only to be self consistent
(i.e. it operates with the user TFTP program,
.IR tftp (1C)).
Due to the unreliability of the transport protocol
(UDP) and the scarcity of TFTP implementations,
it is uncertain whether it really works.
