This is a distribution kit for the first release of the BSD networking
software.  This software is

for details.

Each program is in a separate directory which contains both the source
and the manual page(s) for the program.  The kernel-related sources are
under the sys directory, the include files meant for /usr/include are in
the include directory, and the library routines are in the lib directory.
Additional documentation is in the doc and man directories.

Makefiles:
	-- the Makefiles in these directories use the command mkdep(1)
	-- they also presume a built-in rule in make that knows how to
	   format manual pages, i.e. use "nroff -man -h" to convert the
	   suffixes .1-.8 into the suffix .0.  Diffs for this change
	   are supplied in the make directory.
	-- as part of moving the manual pages into the source tree we
	   removed /usr/man/man* and change the man(1) program to look
	   for manual pages in /usr/man/cat* ONLY.  These makefiles
	   expect the directories /usr/man/cat[1-8] to exist.

Mkdep:
	-- is simply a shell script that formats the output of the -M
	   flag to the compiler and installs the result in a file named
	   ".depend" in the current directory.  This assumes that make
	   reads this file.  If it doesn't, you may wish to use mkdep.append
	   which edits the dependencies into the Makefile itself.  Diffs
	   for this change are supplied in the make directory.
	-- if your compiler doesn't have the -M flag, add it.  If you
	   can't add it, there's a version of mkdep in the mkdep directory
	   that makes an attempt to work anyway.  Ultrix uses the '-Em'
	   flag, there's a version that works with that, also.
