This file lists known problems with this release of FreeBSD

'hanging keyboard'
------------------
There are still problems with certain machines appearing to 'hang' on
bootup even though a prompt is there.  The most common machines that
exhibit these problems are Gateway 2000 machines with PHOENIX bios's but
other machines with PHOENIX bios also exhibit this behavior.
	The temporary solution until you can get the distribution
installed on your hard-drive is to 'bounce' on a key like shift or
num-lock (which works well since you can see when the keyboard comes
back to life) until the boot sequence is finished.  The keyboard will
work fine for installing FreeBSD onto the hard-drive.
	Generally the problems go away at this point, but if it doesn't
you should install a SYSCONS kernel which doesn't experience these
keyboard problems.

/usr/bin/gdb:
	The gdb in the release will not work on shared objects nor will it
	work with C++ executables.  Please use the gdb in the ports area for
	debugging shared and/or C++ code.

/sys/i386/isa/if_ep.c
	The 3c509 driver will hang under heavy network loads and take your
	machine off network.  (Though the machine will continue to run with
	no network facilities)

/sys/i386/isa/syscons.c
	This file will not compile correctly with the compiler distributed
	in FreeBSD before version 1.1.  To compile a FreeBSD 1.1 kernel 
	with a compiler from before FreeBSD 1.1, you will need to add
	the `-D__FreeBSD__' flag to your kernel compiles; e.g.,
		make CC='cc -D__FreeBSD__'
	in /sys/compile/SYSCONS (or substitute the name of your
	configuration.  Once you upgrade your compilation tools this
	will no longer be necessary.
