This file lists known problems with this release of FreeBSD

/usr/bin/gdb:
	The gdb in the release will not work on shared objects nor will it
	work with C++ executables.  Please use the gdb in the ports area for
	debugging shared and/or C++ code.

/sys/i386/isa/if_ep.c
	The 3c509 driver will hang under heavy network loads and take your
	machine off network.  (Though the machine will continue to run with
	no network facilities)

/sys/i386/isa/syscons.c
	This file will not compile correctly with the compiler distributed
	in FreeBSD before version 1.1.  To compile a FreeBSD 1.1 kernel 
	with a compiler from before FreeBSD 1.1, you will need to add
	the additional define to COPTS in your 
	/sys/compile/{KERNEN_NAME}/Makefile.  Add -D__Free_BSD to
	that line.  Once you upgrade your compile this will no longer
	be necessary and that addition can be removed.
