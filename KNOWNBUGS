This file lists known problems with this release of FreeBSD

'hanging keyboard'
------------------
There are still problems with certain machines appearing to 'hang' on
bootup even though a prompt is there.  The most common machines that
exhibit these problems are Gateway 2000 machines with PHOENIX bios's but
other machines with PHOENIX bios also exhibit this behavior.
	The temporary solution until you can get the distribution
installed on your hard-drive is to 'bounce' on a key like shift or
num-lock (which works well since you can see when the keyboard comes
back to life) until the boot sequence is finished.  The keyboard will
work fine for installing FreeBSD onto the hard-drive.
	Generally the problems go away at this point, but if it doesn't
you should install a SYSCONS kernel which doesn't experience these
keyboard problems.

/usr/bin/gdb:
	The gdb in the release will not work on shared objects nor will it
	work with C++ executables.  Please use the gdb in the ports area for
	debugging shared and/or C++ code.  This is just a work-around until
	we can transition to the new version of gdb completely.

/sys/i386/isa/if_ep.c
	The 3c509 driver will hang under heavy network loads and take your
	machine off the network.  (Though the machine will continue to run with
	no network facilities)

/sys/i386/boot
	DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REBUILD THE BOOT BLOCKS.  There is currently
	a problem in that the boot block code has grown and if you build
	it with the new version of as and install them you will NOT BE
	ABLE TO BOOT YOUR SYSTEM.  This problem will be fixed before
	the 1.1 release is ship, and should only exist with the 1.1 BETA
	release.

	The boot block binaries shipped with the 1.1 BETA release were
	built using an older version of as and can be installed safely.

/sys/i386/boot
	You can not have the root file system mounted on /dev/fd1a, it
	panics on you.  This occurs when booting from floppy and answering
	the question for what drive the root file system is on with B.
	This will be fixed by the 1.1 release date.

/sys/i386/isa/bt742a.c
	The Bt445S and Bt747 controllers can cause problems when ISA DMA
	is selected as an option.  With the EISA controller the remedy is
	easy - simply turn it off using your EISA configuration utility.
	With the Bt445S, which is a VLB card, you must switch the undocumented
	"SW10" on "SB2" to the off position.  Also note that certain revisions
	of the Buslogic firmware can cause data corruption with systems
	containing more than 16Mb of memory.  If you find this to be the case,
	temporarily remove your extra memory and contact Buslogic for an
	upgrade.
