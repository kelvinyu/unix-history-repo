Subject: font catalog

It ok by me to include my name in the font catalog page of the 4th
distribution.  My software is intended for a Versatec 1200A printer/plotter
which is 11" wide by 8.5" long.  I far as I know the rotated font
format of your stuff and mine is identical.  My distribution policy
is to give it away to anyone who wrties to me and includes a
blank mag tape.  If you think people may be writing perhaps you
should include my address:
	Thomas Ferrin
	School of Pharmacy
	University of California
	San Francsico, CA 94143
