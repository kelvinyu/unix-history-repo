Computer Modern fonts, roman, \f2italic\f1, and \f3bold\f1. (by Don Knuth)
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 point.
(Available as cm.)
.PP
Note that the cm fonts are intended for TEX and don't fare so well with
troff.  The spacing is not proportional by point size, and hence only
one point size can be tuned to be nicely spaced.  We have tuned the 10
point size, but the 8 point looks somewhat cramped.
.PP
Some of the punctuation is missing in some of the fonts.
Knuth also uses a nonstandard notion of ASCII, and hence
some glyphs are available only with special symbols such as \e(12.
Others cannot be accessed at all.
.PP
Knuth's fonts somewhat larger than normal, since he intends the output
to be reduced before printing.  Since troff has a limitation of 7.54
inches width on output, this is not practical.  Hence, the original
fonts have been relabelled with the point size they are closest to
without reduction.  Some fonts (6 point bold, 7 point roman, 8 point
italic and bold, 9 point bold, and 11 point italic) which would have
otherwise been missing were generated by shrinking the next larger
point size of the same style.  (This goes against the idea of metafont,
but we use the tools we have.)

If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be,
as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality; since, as he elsewhere
tells us, lost time is never found again; and what we call time enough,
always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing
to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity.
