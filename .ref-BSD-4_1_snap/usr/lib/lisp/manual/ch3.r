                    Arithmetic Functions







   _3._1.  This chapter describes FRANZ LISP's  functions  for
      doing  arithmetic.  Often the same function is know by
      many names, such as _a_d_d which is also _p_l_u_s,  _s_u_m,  and
      +.   This  is  due to our desire to be compatible with
      other Lisps.  The FRANZ LISP user is advised to  avoid
      using  functions  with  names  such  as + and * unless
      their arguments are fixnums.  The lisp compiler  takes
      advantage  of  the  fact that their arguments are fix-
      nums.

           An attempt to divide by zero will cause a  float-
      ing  exception  signal from the UNIX operating system.
      The user can catch and process this  interrupt  if  he
      wishes (see the description of the _s_i_g_n_a_l function).



(abs 'n_arg)

     RETURNS: the absolute value of n_arg.


(absval 'n_arg)

     EQUIVALENT TO: abs.


(add ['n_arg1 ...])

     RETURNS: the sum of the arguments. If no arguments  are
              given, 0 is returned.

     NOTE: if the size of the partial sum exceeds the  limit
           of a fixnum, the partial sum will be converted to
           a bignum.  If any of the arguments  are  flonums,
           the  partial  sum  will  be converted to a flonum
           when that argument is processed  and  the  result
           will thus be a flonum.  Currently, if in the pro-
           cess of doing the addition a bignum must be  con-
           verted  into  a  flonum  an  error  message  will
           result.

(acos 'fx_arg)

     RETURNS: the arc cosine of fx_arg in the range 0 to Ji.

(boole 'x_key 'x_v1 'x_v2 ...)

     RETURNS: the result of the bitwise boolean operation as
              described in the following table.

     NOTE: If there are more than 3 arguments, then  evalua-
           tion  proceeds  left  to  right with each partial
           result becoming the new value of x_v1.  That is,
                (_b_o_o_l_e '_k_e_y '_v_1 '_v_2 '_v_3) =_ (_b_o_o_l_e '_k_e_y (_b_o_o_l_e '_k_e_y '_v_1 '_v_2) '_v_3).
           In the following table, * represents bitwise and,
           + represents bitwise or, O+ represents bitwise xor
           and  _  represents  bitwise  negation  and is the
           highest precedence operator.

(cos 'fx_angle)

     RETURNS: the cosine of fx_angle (which is assumed to be
              in radians).


(diff ['n_arg1 ... ])

     RETURNS: the result of subtracting from n_arg1 all sub-
              sequent  arguments. If no arguments are given,
              0 is returned.

     NOTE: See the description of add for  details  on  data
           type conversions and restrictions.


(difference ['n_arg1 ...])

     EQUIVALENT TO: diff.


(Divide 'i_dividend 'i_divisor)

     RETURNS: a list whose car is  the  quotient  and  whose
              cadr  is  the  remainder  of  the  division of
              i_dividend by i_divisor.

     NOTE: this is restricted to integer division.


(Emuldiv 'x_fact1 'x_fact2 'x_addn 'x_divisor)

     RETURNS: a list of the quotient and remainder  of  this
              operation:
              ((x_fact1 * x_fact2) + (sign extended) x_addn) / x_divisor.

     NOTE: this  is  useful for creating a bignum arithmetic
           package in Lisp.


(exp 'fx_arg)

     RETURNS: _e raised to the fx_arg power.

(expt 'n_base 'n_power)

     RETURNS: n_base raised to the i_power power.

     NOTE: if either of the arguments are flonums, the  cal-
           culation will be done using _l_o_g and _e_x_p.


(fact 'x_arg)

     RETURNS: x_arg factorial.


(fix 'n_arg)

     RETURNS: a fixnum as close as we can get to n_arg.

     NOTE: _f_i_x will round down.  Currently, if  n_arg  is  a
           flonum  larger  than  the  size of a fixnum, this
           will fail.


(fixp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is a fixnum or bignum.


(float 'n_arg)

     RETURNS: a flonum as close as we can get to n_arg.

     NOTE: if n_arg is a bignum larger than the maximum size
           of  a  flonum,  then  a  floating  exception will
           occur.


(floatp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is a flonum.


(greaterp ['n_arg1 ...])

     RETURNS: t iff the arguments are in a strictly decreas-
              ing order.

     NOTE: the function difference is used to compare  adja-
           cent  values.  If  any  of  the arguments are non
           numbers, the error message  will  come  from  the
           difference function.

(haipart bx_number x_bits)

     RETURNS: the x_bits high bits of |bx_number| if  x_bits
              is positive, otherwise it returns the |x_bits|
              low bits of |bx_number|.


(haulong bx_number)

     RETURNS: the number of significant bits in bx_number.

     NOTE: the result is equal to the least integer  greater
           to   or  equal  to  the  base  two  logarithm  of
           |bx_number| + 1.


(lessp ['n_arg1 ...])

     RETURNS: t iff the arguments are in a strictly increas-
              ing order.

     NOTE: the function _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is used to compare  adja-
           cent  values.  If  any  of  the arguments are non
           numbers, the error message  will  come  from  the
           _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e function.


(log 'fx_arg)

     RETURNS: the natural logarithm of fx_arg.


(lsh 'x_val 'x_amt)

     RETURNS: x_val shifted left by x_amt if x_amt is  posi-
              tive.   If x_amt is negative, then _l_s_h returns
              x_val shifted right by the magnitude if x_amt.

(product ['n_arg1 ... ])

     RETURNS: the product  of  all  of  its  arguments.   It
              returns 1 if there are no arguments.
