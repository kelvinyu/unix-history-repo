.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tset
causes terminal dependent processing such as setting
erase and kill characters, setting or resetting delays,
and the like.
It first determines the
.I type
of terminal involved, names for which are specified by the
.I /etc/termcap
data base, and then
does necessary initializations and mode settings.
In the case where no argument types are specified,
.I tset
simply reads the terminal type out of the environment variable TERM
and re-initializes the terminal.  The rest of this manual concerns
itself with type initialization, done typically once at login, and options
used at initialization time to determine the terminal type and set up
terminal modes.
.PP
When used in a startup script
.I \&.profile
(for
.IR sh (1)
users) or
.I \&.login
(for
.IR csh (1)
users) it is desirable to give information about the types of terminal
usually used on terminals which are not hardwired.
These ports are initially identified as being
.I dialup
or
.I plugboard
or
.I arpanet
etc.
To specify
what terminal type is usually used on these ports
.B \-m
is followed by the appropriate port type identifier,
an optional baud-rate specification,
and the terminal type to be used if the mapping conditions are satisfied.
If more than one mapping is specified, the first applicable mapping prevails.
A missing type identifier matches all identifiers.
.PP
Baud rates are specified as with
.IR stty (1),
and are compared with the
speed of the diagnostic output (which is almost always the control terminal).
The baud rate test may be any combination of:
.B >,
.B =,
.B <,
.B @,
and
.B !;
.B @
is a synonym for
.B =
and
.B !
inverts the sense of the test.  To avoid problems with metacharacters, it
is best to place the entire argument to
.B \-m
within ``\''' characters; users of
.IR csh (1)
must also put a ``\e'' before any ``!'' used here.
.PP
Thus
.IP
tset \-m  \'dialup>300:adm3a\'  \-m  dialup:dw2  \-m  \'plugboard:?adm3a\'
.LP
causes the terminal type to be set to an
.I adm3a
if the port in use is a dialup at a speed greater than 300 baud;
to a 
.I dw2
if the port is (otherwise) a dialup (i.e. at 300 baud or less).
If the
.I type
above begins with a question mark,
the user is asked if s/he really wants that type.
A null response means to use that type;
otherwise, another type can be entered which will be used instead.
Thus, in this case, the user will be queried on a plugboard port
as to whether they are using an
.I adm3a.
For other ports the port type will be taken from the
/etc/ttytype file or a final, default
.I type
option may be given on the command line not preceded by a
.B \-m.
.PP
It is often desirable to return the terminal type, as specified by the
.B \-m
options, and information about the terminal
to a shell's environment.  This can be done using the
.B \-s
option; using the Bourne shell,
.IR sh (1):
.IP
eval \`tset \-s \fIoptions...\fR\`
.LP
or using the C shell,
.IR csh (1):
.IP
set noglob; eval \`tset \-s \fIoptions...\fR\`
.PP
These commands cause
.I tset
to generate as output a sequence of shell commands which place the variables
TERM and TERMCAP in the environment; see
.IR environ (5).
.PP
Once the terminal type is known,
.I tset
engages in terminal mode setting.
This normally involves sending an initialization sequence to the
terminal and setting the single character erase (and optionally
the line-kill (full line erase)) characters.
.PP
On terminals that can backspace but not overstrike
(such as a \s-2CRT\s0),
and when the erase character is the default erase character
(`#' on standard systems),
the erase character is changed to a Control-H
(backspace).
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B \-e
set the erase character to be the named character
.I c
on all terminals,
the default being the backspace character on the terminal, usually ^H.
.TP
.B \-k
is similar to
.B \-e
but for the line kill character rather than the erase character;
.I c
defaults to ^X (for purely historical reasons); ^U is the preferred setting.
No kill processing is done if
.B \-k
is not specified.
.TP
.B \-I
supresses outputting terminal initialization strings.
.TP
.B \-Q
supresses printing the
``Erase set to'' and ``Kill set to'' messages.
.TP
.B \-S
Outputs the strings to be assigned to
TERM and TERMCAP in the environment rather than commands for a shell.

.SH NOTES
For compatibility with earlier versions of
.I tset
a number of flags are accepted whose use is discouraged:
.TP 10
\fB\-d\fR type
equivalent to
.B \-m
dialup:type
.TP 10
\fB\-p\fR type
equivalent to
.B \-m
plugboard:type
.TP 10
\fB\-a\fR type
equivalent to
.B \-m
arpanet:type
.TP 10
\fB\-E\fR c
Sets the erase character to
.I c
only if the terminal can backspace.
.TP 10
\fB\-\fR
prints the terminal type on the standard output
.TP 10
\fB\-r\fR
prints the terminal type on the diagnostic output.
