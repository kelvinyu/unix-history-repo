.TH RC 8
.UC 4
.SH NAME
rc \- command script for auto-reboot and daemons
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/rc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rc
is the command script which controls the automatic reboot
.PP
When an automatic reboot is in progress,
.I rc
is invoked with the argument
.I autoboot
and runs a
.I fsck
with option
.B \-p
to ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting
from the last system shutdown and to check for serious inconsistencies
caused by hardware or software failure.
If this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the second part of
.I rc
is run.
.PP
The second part of
.I rc,
which is run after a auto-reboot succeeds and also if
.I rc
is invoked when a single user shell terminates (see
.IR init (8)),
starts all the daemons on the system, preserves editor files
and clears the scratch directory
.B /tmp.
