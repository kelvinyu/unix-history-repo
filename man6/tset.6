.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tset
causes terminal dependent processing such as setting
erase and kill characters, setting or resetting delays,
and the like.
It is driven by the
.it /etc/ttytype
and
.it /etc/ttycap
files.
.s3
The type of terminal is specified by the
.bd \-f
flag.
The type may be any type given in
.it /etc/ttycap.
If
.it type
is not specified,
it defaults to a \s-2DTC\s0 terminal.
If
.bd \-f
is not specified,
the terminal type is read from
.it /etc/htmp
(the home directory and terminal type database)
if
.bd \-h
is specified, otherwise it is looked up in
.it /etc/ttytype
based on the terminal id.
The terminal id is specified by the
.bd \-t
flag or from a
.it ttyn
(III)
call on the standard output.
.s3
If the type turns out to be a dialup and the
.bd \-d
flag is specified,
the terminal type is taken to be the named type.
.s3
On terminals that can backspace but not overstrike
(such as a \s-2CRT\s0)
the erase character is changed to a \s-2CTRL\s0(H)
(backspace).
The
.bd \-e
flag sets the erase character to be the named character
.it c
on all terminals,
so to override this option one can say
\fB\-e\fR#.
The default for
.it c
is \s-2CTRL\s0(H).
The
.bd \-k
option works similarly,
with
.it c
defaulting to \s-2CTRL\s0(X).
No kill processing is done if
.bd \-k
is not specified.
.s3
The terminal type specified in 
.it htmp
is updated if
.bd \-u
is specified or if the
.bd \-d
flag took effect.
.s3
.it Tset
is most useful when included in the
.bd \&.start_up
file executed automatically at login,
with
.bd \-d
used to specify the terminal type you most frequently dial in on.
