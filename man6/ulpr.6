.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ulpr
is a filter which takes the output of the new version of

and rearranges the underlining so that the output will print
at a reasonable speed with the current line printer daemon, which
is unhappy with the way
.it nroff
underlines.

.it ulpr
would be

or one character with an underline survive.
