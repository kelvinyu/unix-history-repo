.bd block
spacing plotchar line1 line2 ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Block
converts its line arguments into 6x5 dot-matrix
format, and prints them on the standard output.
The matrix is constructed using `plotchar' as the print element;
each block-character is separated by `spacing' blanks.
Thus
.s3
.dt
	block 1 x "Que pasa," " Baby ?"
.s3
prints
.s3
.ci +5

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Block without arguments prints its argument conventions.
.sh BUGS
There are no lower case characters;
all characters are treated as though upper case.
Also, non-printing ASCII characters are treated as blanks.
.s3
It is not a bug, but to use `*' as the plotchar you must quote it,
i.e.
.s3
.dt
	block 2 \e* Boo!
