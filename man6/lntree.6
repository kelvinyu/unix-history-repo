.th LNTREE VI 8/5/77
.sh NAME
lntree \- make a duplicate tree using links
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd lntree
[
.bd \-
]
[
.bd \-q
]
source dest
.sh DESCRIPTION
The tree rooted at
.it source
is duplicated, using
.it mkdir
(I) and
.it link
(II)
in a copy rooted at the directory
.it dest,
which must already exits.
Both
.it source
and
.it dest
must be on the same file system.
.it Cptree
(I) can be used if they are not,
but the effects of
.it lntree
and
.it cptree
are quite different.
It is an extremely fatal error for
.it dest
to be a subdirectory of
.it source.
.it Lntree
makes a prepass at the
.it source
subtree to insure that this is not the case.
.s3
If special files are present in the source,
.it lntree 
requires confirmation
that the links are really to be made.
The
.bd \- 
option suppresses the request for confirmation;
.it lntree
then links to special file without
complaint.
.s3
For the super-user,
.it lntree 
will also make new quota files corresponding
to any old ones it finds, and change the ownership of all the directories
and quota files it makes to the owner of the corresponding files in the
.it source
tree.
The
.bd \-q
option suppresses creation
of new quota files.
