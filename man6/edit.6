.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Edit
is a variant of the text editor
.it ex
recommended for new or casual users.
With
.it edit,
the default settings of the options are changed
so that there are fewer ``magic'' characters in regular
expressions (\fInomagic\fR),
so that more feedback is given in command changes
(\fInotify\fR\|=1),
and so that accidental entry to
.it open
or
.it visual
is prevented (\fInoopen\fR).
This provides a more hospitable editing environment.
.s3
Except for the default settings of these options,
.it edit
is identical to
.it ex;
the two may be used interchangeably.
