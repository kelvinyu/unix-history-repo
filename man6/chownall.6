.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Chownall
systematically changes ownerships of files in the subtree rooted
at each base directory.
The format of the changes is determined by the
ownership
of the base directory and well as the options specified.
The options are
.bd \-
for terse,
.bd \-a
for all,
and
.bd \-g
and
.bd \-u
for specifying new decimal user and group options.
The
.bd \-n
option can be used to conveniently give the
new user number via a user name.
Four uses can be distinguished:
.s2
.lp +5 5
1) Only \fB\-g\fR flag specified
.br
The base directory must be owned by user 0 in a group other than group 0.
All files in the subtree owned by any user of this group are changed to
be owned by the same user (numerically) in the specified new group.
.sp
.lp +5 5
2) Only \fB\-u\fR flag specified
.br
The base directory must be owned by a person who is not user number 0 in
his group.
All files in the subtree owned by this person are changed
to be owned by the specified new user number in the same group.
.sp
.lp +5 5
3) Both \fB\-g\fR and \fB\-u\fR flags specified
.br
All files in the subtree owned by the owner of the base directory become
owned by the specified group and user.
.sp
.lp +5 5
4) \fB\-A\fR, \fB\-g\fR, and \fB\-u\fR flags specified, or \fB\-n\fR flag given
.br
All files in the subtree rooted at the given directory are changed to be
owned by the newly specified user and group.
This option requires confirmation
which may be given on the command line via the `-' terse option.

.sh EXAMPLES
.lp +6 6
chownall \-g64 /mnt/comc
.br
If /mnt/compc is owned by group 138 user 0, this command changes
all files in the tree rooted there which are presently owned by members
of group 138 to be owned by the same relative user in group 64.

chownall \-nbill /mnt/bill

.sh BUGS
Shouldn't need
.bd \-n
as it should be the ``default''
so that
.it chownall
would work like
.it chown.
.s3
The
.bd \-g
and
.bd \-u
flags are of questionable value.
