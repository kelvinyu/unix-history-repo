.sh NAME
flt40 \- floating point assembly language speed up massager
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd flt40
slowcode fastcode
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Flt40
reads the assembly language program off the file
.it slowcode
and writes a transformed program on
.it fastcode.
The transformation consists of placing the statement
.s3
.dt
	jsr	pc,fpjsr
.s3
before each group of floating point operations.
On machines which don't have floating point hardware, this
can speed execution time significantly, as the system overhead
associated with floating point interpretation is eliminated.
.s3
.it Flt40
is most appropriately called directly from the C compiler pre-processor
.it cc;
an option
.bd \-F
to call
.it flt40
is a useful addition on machines without floating point hardware.

.sh BUGS
The name
.it flt40
is an anachronism;
the program works perfectly well on 11/45's and 70's.
.s3
The input is recognized only if it is in C format;
thus there can be no leading tabs before operation codes.
