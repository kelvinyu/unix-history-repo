.th IUL VI 8/24/77
.sh NAME
iul \- indicate underlining
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd iul
[
file ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
This filter provides the same function as the
.it indicateul
option of
.it ex
(VI)
breaking underlining onto separate lines as dashing with `\-'.
It is handy when you want to look at the underlining which is present
in an
.it nroff
output stream on a soft-copy terminal.
A typical usage of
.it iul
would be
.dt
.s3
	nroff \-ms pcxin1.n | iul
.sh SEE\ ALSO
colcrt (VI), ex (VI)
.sh BUGS
Overstriking is lost.
.s3
The program
.it colcrt
has all of the features of
.it iul,
so that
.it iul
is superfluous is some sense.
.it Iul
is, however, much more efficient that
.it colcrt.
