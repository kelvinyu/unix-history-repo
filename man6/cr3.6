.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Cr3
is a filter which allows causual examination of a continuous text
on a soft-copy terminal.
It normally pauses after each 23 lines of output.
If the user then hits a carriage-return, 23 more lines are displayed.
If the user hits control-d,
11 more lines are displayed (a ``scroll'').
.s3
It is also possible to type positive numbers to cr3 causing that
many lines to be printed, or negative numbers causing that many lines
to be discarded followed by a scroll.
.s3
The terminal is set to
.it noecho
mode by this program so that the output can be continuous.
The numbers and carriage returns you type will thus not show on your terminal.
