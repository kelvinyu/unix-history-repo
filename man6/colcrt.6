.sh NAME
colcrt \- simulate model 37 tty with a soft-copy terminal
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd colcrt
[
.bd \-
] [
.bd \-2
] [
file ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Colcrt
provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
is destructive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `\-')
are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.
.s3
The optional
.bd \- 
suppresses all underlining.
It is especially useful for previewing
.it allboxed
tables from
.it tbl
(I).
.s3
The option
.bd \-2
causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the output.
Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty
lines.
The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however.
The
.bd \-2
option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output
contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.
.s3
A typical use of
.it colcrt
would be
.s3
.dt
	tbl exum2.n | nroff \-ms | colcrt \- | cr3
.sh "SEE ALSO"
col (VI), nroff/troff (I), collpr (VI), cr3 (VI)

.sh BUGS
Should fold `_'s onto blanks even with the
`\fB\-\fR'
option so that
a true underline character would show; if we did this, however,
.it colcrt
wouldn't get rid of
.it cu'd
underlining
completely.
.s3
Can't back up more than 102 lines.
.s3
General overstriking is lost;
as a special case `|' overstruck with `\-' or `_' becomes `+'.
.s3
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
.s3
Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
in documents which are already double-spaced, either here or in
.it collpr.
