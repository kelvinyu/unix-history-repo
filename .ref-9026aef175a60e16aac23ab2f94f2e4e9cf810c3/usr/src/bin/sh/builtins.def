# This file lists all the builtin commands.  The first column is the name
# of a C routine.  The -j flag, if present, specifies that this command
# is to be excluded from systems without job control, and the -h flag,
# if present specifies that this command is to be excluded from systems
# based on the NO_HISTORY compile-time symbol.  The rest of the line
# specifies the command name or names used to run the command.  The entry
# for bltincmd, which is run when the user does not specify a command, must
# come first.
#
# NOTE: bltincmd must come first!
