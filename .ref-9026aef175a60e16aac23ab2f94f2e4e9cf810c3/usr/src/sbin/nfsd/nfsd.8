server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Fl rut
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nfsd
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, four servers for
.Tn UDP
transport are started.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr portmap 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl n
Specifies how many servers to create.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.El
.Pp
For example, 
.Dq Li "nfsd -u -t 6"
serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using six daemons.
.Pp
A server should run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
.Nm Nfsd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094 and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" .

The
.Nm nfsd
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
