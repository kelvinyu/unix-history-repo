.Sh NAME
.Nm ranlib
.Nd preprocess archives for efficient linking
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ranlib
.Op Fl t
.Ar archive_file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ranlib
is a preprocessor for the loading utility
.Xr ld 1 .
.Nm Ranlib
creates a randomized library from the given
.Ar archive_file
with
the file entry named
.Sy \&__.SYMDEF
prepended.
The
.Sy \&__.SYMDEF
file entry is a dictionary the loader can detect and interpret
to resolve external references at link time.
To generate the library, the
.Xr ar 1
utility is used.
.Tw 8n
.Tp Fl t
Ranlib only "touches" the archives and does not modify them.
This is useful after copying an archive
or using the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr make  1
in order to avoid having
.Xr ld  1
complain about
an
.Dq out of date
symbol table.

.Xr ar 1 ,
.Xr ld 1 ,
.Xr lorder 1 ,
.Xr make 1 ,
.Xr nm 1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Ranlib
appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
.Sh BUGS
The archiving is a separate process and phase
errors may occur (see the
.Fl t
option above).
