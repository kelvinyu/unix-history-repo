DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       rrccsscclleeaann  removes  working files that were checked out and
       never modified.  For each _f_i_l_e  given,  rrccsscclleeaann  compares
       the  working  file and a revision in the corresponding RCS
       file.  If it finds a difference, it does nothing.   Other-
       wise,  it  first  unlocks the revision if the --uu option is
       given, and then removes the working file unless the  work-
       ing  file is writable and the revision is locked.  It logs
       its actions by outputting the corresponding rrccss --uu and  rrmm
       --ff commands on the standard output.

       If  no  _f_i_l_e  is  given,  all working files in the current
       directory are cleaned.  Pathnames matching an  RCS  suffix
       denote  RCS files; all others denote working files.  Names
       are paired as explained in ccii(1).

       The number of the revision to which the  working  file  is
       compared may be attached to any of the options --nn, --qq, --rr,
       or --uu.  If no revision number is specified, then if the --uu
       option  is  given  and the caller has one revision locked,
       rrccsscclleeaann uses that revision; otherwise rrccsscclleeaann  uses  the
       latest  revision on the default branch, normally the root.

       rrccsscclleeaann is useful for cclleeaann targets  in  Makefiles.   See
       also  rrccssddiiffff(1),  which  prints  out the differences, and
       ccii(1), which normally asks whether to check in a  file  if
       it was not changed.

       --kk_s_u_b_s_t
              Use  _s_u_b_s_t style keyword substitution when retriev-
              ing the revision for  comparison.   See  ccoo(1)  for
              details.

       --nn[_r_e_v]
              Do  not  actually  remove  any  files or unlock any
              revisions.  Using this option will  tell  you  what
              rrccsscclleeaann would do without actually doing it.

       --qq[_r_e_v]
              Do not log the actions taken on standard output.

       --rr[_r_e_v]
              This option has no effect other than specifying the
              revision for comparison.

       --uu[_r_e_v]
              Unlock  the  revision  if  it  is  locked  and   no

              difference is found.

       --VV_n    Emulate RCS version _n.  See ccoo(1) for details.

       --xx_s_u_f_f_i_x_e_s
              Use  _s_u_f_f_i_x_e_s to characterize RCS files.  See ccii(1)
              for details.

              rrccsscclleeaann  **..cc  **..hh

       removes all working files ending in ..cc or ..hh that were not
       changed since their checkout.

              rrccsscclleeaann

       removes  all  working  files in the current directory that
       were not changed since their checkout.

FFIILLEESS
       rrccsscclleeaann accesses files much as ccii(1) does.

              options prepended to the argument  list,  separated
              by  spaces.   A  backslash escapes spaces within an
              option.  The RRCCSSIINNIITT options are prepended  to  the
              argument   lists  of  most  RCS  commands.   Useful
              RRCCSSIINNIITT options include --qq, --VV, and --xx.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
       successful.   Missing  working  files  and  RCS  files are
       silently ignored.
