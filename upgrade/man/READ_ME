The manuals here supplement the main man directory for the programs
in ../src.

Unfortunately the manual stuff on the tape is in version 7 format.
If you have version 6 manual macros they will not work directly, but
most upper case macros correspond to old lower case macros with similar
names, thus the new macro .TH corresponds to the old .th.
The macros .TP and .HP are similar to the old .lp and the macro
.IR is like
	.de IR
	\&\fB\\$1\fR\\$2
	..

Since most manuals sections include only a few macro calls you can probably
retrofit them with a simple editor script (although I haven't tried this).

The tmac.* files here contain a copy of the macros used here.
If you place them all in /usr/lib/tmac, then the supplied ``man'' command
will run off both old and new manuals.
