Files here supplement those in subdirectories of .. for version 6 systems.

include		Header files for libretro.  These must be installed in
		/usr/include/retrofit and /usr/include/retrofit/sys.

src		Programs replacing some of those in those in ../src for 
		version 6 systems, plus a few ones which are needed only on 
		version 6, (such as ``setenv'').

man		Manual stuff for things in src and parts of libretro, and to
		fit manual sections onto old systems.

libretro	A library which maps version 7 onto version 6 for some
		of the system calls.  If your system doesn't correspond
		to a standard v6 system you may have to change this and
		recompile most programs.  This is generally necessary only
		if you have 16 bit user id's returning from getuid().

c		This details the changes made to the C compiler locally
		to compile some of the the binaries on this tape.
		These are not necessary unless you need to recompile ex,
		and then you really only need a C compiler with a larger
		symbol table.
