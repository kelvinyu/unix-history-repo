.sh NAME
ar \*- archive and library maintainer
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ar
key [ posname ] afile name ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ar
maintains groups of files
combined into a single archive file.
Its main use
is to create and update library files as used by the loader.
It can be used, though, for any similar purpose.
.s3
.it Key
is one character from the set
.bd drtpmx,
optionally concatenated with
.bd vuai.
.it Afile
is the archive file.
The
.it names
are constituent files in the archive file.
The meanings of the
.it key
characters are:
.s3
.bd d
means delete the named files from the archive file.
.s3
.bd r
means replace the named files in the archive file.
If the optional character
.bd u
is used with
.bd r,
then only those files with
modified dates later than
the archive files are replaced.
If the optional positioning character
.bd a
(also
.bd i
)
is used, then the
.it posname
argument must be present
and specifies a file in the archive
after (before for
.bd i
)
which new files are placed.
Without
.bd a
or
.bd i,
new files are placed at the end.
.s3
.bd t
prints a table of contents of the archive file.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are tabled.
If names are given, only those files are tabled.
.s3
.bd p
prints the named files in the archive.
.s3
.bd m
moves the named files to the end of the archive.
If the options
.bd i
or
.bd b
are used, then the
.it posname
argument must be present and,
as in
.bd r,
specifies where the files are to be moved
.s3
.bd x
extracts the named files.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are
extracted.
In neither case does
.bd x
alter the archive file.
.s3
.bd v
means verbose.
Under the verbose option,
.it ar
gives a file-by-file
description of the making of a
new archive file from the old archive and the constituent files.
When used with
.bd t,
it gives a long listing of all information about the files.
.sh FILES

.sh BUGS
If the same file is mentioned twice in an argument list,
it may be put in the archive twice.
