                                    FreeBSD
                                Release 1.0 GAMMA

1. Technical overview
---------------------

FreeBSD is a freely available, full source 4.3 (+4.4 enhancements) BSD
release for Intel i386/i486 (or compatable) based PC's.  It is based
heavily on Bill Jolitz's 386BSD 0.1, with additions from "the patchkit",
NetBSD, CSRG, and the Free Software Foundation.

Many hundreds of bugs from the 386BSD 0.1 distribution were fixed,
and many out-of-date pieces of software were upgraded to their current
releases.

Additionally, many packages such as XFree86 1.3, xview 3.2, elm, nntp,
mh and dozens of other miscellaneous utilities have been ported and
are now available as add-ons.  See then next section of this document
for more details.

For a list of contributors, please see the file "CONTRIB.FreeBSD",
which should be bundled with your distribution.

The core of FreeBSD does not contain DES code so that it can be
exported outside the United States.  There is an add on package to
the core distribution for use only in the United States that contains
the programs that normally use DES.  The auxilliary packages are
provided separately for use by anyone.

2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------

FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA and EISA bus based
PC's, ranging from 386sx to 486 class machines (though the 386sx is
not recommended).  Support for basic IDE/ESDI drive configurations,
various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is also provided.

Following is a list of all currently known disk controllers and
ethernet cards known to work with FreeBSD.  Other configurations may
very well work, and we have simply not received any indication of
this.


2.1. Disk Controllers

WD1003 (IDE)

Adaptec 1542{A,B,C} ISA SCSI controller.

Adaptec 174x EISA SCSI controller in standard and enhanced mode.

DTC 3290 EISA SCSI controller in emulation mode.

Bustec 742A.

Ultra Store 14F and 34F.

In all SCSI configurations, full support is provided for SCSI-I &
SCSI-II peripherals, including Disks, Tape drives (including DAT) and
CDROM drives.


2.2. Ethernet cards

SMC Elite 16 WD8013 ethernet interface, and most other WD8003E,
WD8003EBT, WD8003S, WD8003SBT and WD8013EBT based clones.

Isolan AT 4141-0 (16 bit)

Isolink 4110     (8 bit)

Novell NE2000 ethernet interface.

2.3. Misc

Various 2 and 4 port serial/parallel cards


FreeBSD does NOT support IBM's microchannel (MCA) bus.

3. Obtaining FreeBSD.
---------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:

1. FTP/Mail

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`freebsd.cdrom.com' - the offical FreeBSD release site.  By the time
you read this, it may also be on one or more "mirror" sites somewhere
else on the internet; check with archie for details.

If you do not have access to the internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files from freebsd.cdrom.com.
Note: This approach will end up sending many *tens of megabytes*
through the mail, and should only be employed as an absolute LAST
resort!


2. CDROM

FreeBSD may be ordered on CD from Walnut Creek CDROM, 4041 Pike Lane,
Suite E, Concord, Ca. 94520.  1-800-786-9907 or 1-510-674-0783.

Cost is $39.95 + $5 S&H in the U.S. and Canada, $10.00 overseas.
California residents please add sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.

It should be noted, lest you get the wrong impression that "FreeBSD"
is anything but, that almost no one in the "core team" makes money
from distributions or anything else connected with FreeBSD.  We simply
provide this information as a public service for those wishing to get
their releases from somewhere other than the net (and the easier it
is for you to obtain our software, the happier we are).


4. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached if you can!).

The prefered method to submit bug reports from an internet attached
machine is to use the sendbug command.  Bug reports will be
dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can be sure
that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon as
possible.

If you can not use the sendbug command to submit your bug please send
it to one of the following email locations.

hundreds, of individuals from around the world who have worked very
hard to bring you this release.  It would be very difficult, if not
impossible, to enumerate everyone who's contributed to FreeBSD, but
nonetheless we shall try (in alphabetical order, of course). If your
name is not mentioned, please be assured that its omission is entirely
accidental.
