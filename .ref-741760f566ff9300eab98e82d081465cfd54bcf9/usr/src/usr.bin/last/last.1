.SH NAME
last \- indicate last logins of users and ttys
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlast\fP [-f file] [-#] [users ...] [ttys ...] [hosts ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fILast\fP will list the sessions of specified \fIusers,\fP \fIttys,\fP
and \fIhosts,\fP in reverse time order.  Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.  If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a reboot, \fIlast\fP will so indicate.
.PP
\fILast\fP reads the file \fIfile\fP, or by default, /usr/adm/wtmp.
The \fI-#\fP option limits the report to \fI#\fP lines.
.PP
Other arguments specify \fIusers,\fP \fIttys\fP or \fIhosts\fP of interest.
Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, e.g., "last 03" is equivalent
to "last tty03".  Host names should not include domain information, and
may be internet numbers.  If multiple arguments are given, the information
which applies to any of the arguments is printed, e.g., "last root console"
would list all of "root's" sessions as well as all sessions on the console
terminal. If no users or terminals are specified, \fIlast\fP prints a record
of all logins and logouts.
.PP
The pseudo-user \fBreboot\fP logs in at reboots of the system, thus
.DT
.PP
	last reboot
.PP
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.PP
If \fIlast\fP is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal \fIlast\fP indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.

.SH BUGS
\fILast\fP does not distinguish between different types of information.  The
command "last ucbvax" will report all sessions of the user "ucbvax" as well
as all logins from the host "ucbvax.berkeley.edu".
