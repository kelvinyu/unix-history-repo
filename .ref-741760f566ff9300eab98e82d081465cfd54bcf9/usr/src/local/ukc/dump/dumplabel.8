allows initial labelling of tapes to be used for file system dumps by the
.I dump
(8) program.
If the -f switch is given, the following argument is used as the device which
is to be used for labelling (default /dev/rmt8).
The -r switch rewinds the tape and puts the tape offline after each label is
made.
The optional arguments may be followed by one or more tape label
specificiations.
A tape label is assumed to be a six character string of three letters
followed by three digits.
The tape specification may contain a range of the form LLLnnn-eee, where
nnn is a decimal number lower than eee.
If a tape range is given, the operator is prompted to mount tapes.
.PP
The program /etc/dumplabpr
prints the tape label on the currently mounted tape.
If the tape drive to be used is not /dev/rmt8, then the command can
be followed by an alternative tape device name.
