-------- Remove this line and what's below it, for reference only. --------

To ensure that your bug report is handled correctly by bugfiler(8),
you must replace both "folder" and "version", on the line above
starting with "Index:", with one of the following values:

	folder  ::= bin | etc | games | ideas | include | lib | local |
			man | misc | new | sys | ucb | usr.bin | usr.lib
	version ::= V7 | 2BSD | 4.1BSD | 4.2BSD | 4.3BSD

For example, if your bug concerns the program "/usr/bin/file" and you're
currently running 4.2BSD, you should replace "folder" with "usr.bin", and
"version" with "4.2BSD".  The folder "ideas" is for suggestions.
