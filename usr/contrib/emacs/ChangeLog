	* CHANGES IN THE EMACS DIRECTORY FOR THE 4.3BSD DISTRIBUTION
	____________________________________________________________

	* src/config.h, src/paths.h:
	Provide sample versions of these files (see INSTALL for details).
	These should work on VAXen with vanilla directories.  For other
	CPU's, you'll have to change config.h; if you've moved directories
	around, change paths.h.  If you are running the X window system,
	change ``#undef HAVE_X_WINDOWS'' to ``#define HAVE_X_WINDOWS''
	in config.h.

	* lisp/mh-e.el (MH mail-handler front end):
	Replace with latest version (3.3) by ucbvax!larus.  This
	version incorporates some fixes/improvements that are not
	yet in the FSF distribution (as of the date above).
	Share and enjoy.

	* etc/emacs.1 (troff'able man page):
	Change pathnames in FILES section to reflect where they are
	in this distribution.

	* INSTALL (installation guide):
	Say in LOSSAGES section to disregard `BSD redefined' and
	`BSD4_3 redefined' warning messages.

	* build-install (shell script to build and install emacs):
	Rearrange the installation part somewhat, since 4.3 systems
	typically have sources living in a different places from libraries.
	(Here at Berkeley, sources are all maintained on one machine
	and libraries are distributed to other machines over a local network;
	the script is now set up for this kind of environment).

	* README (note to installer):
	Insert pointer to this file.

	* dbx and cpp are not included on the distribution.
