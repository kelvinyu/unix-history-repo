       The object of the game _h_u_n_t is to kill off the other play-
       ers.   There  are no rooms, no treasures, and no monsters.
       Instead, you wander around a  maze,  find  grenades,  trip
       mines, and shoot down walls and players.  The more players
       you kill before you die, the better your score is.  If the
       --mm flag is given, you enter the game as a monitor (you can
       see the action but you cannot play).

       _H_u_n_t normally looks for an active game on the  local  net-
       work;  if  none  is  found,  it starts one up on the local
       host.  The location of the game may be specified by giving
       the  _h_o_s_t  argument.  This presupposes that a hunt game is
       already running on that host, see _h_u_n_t_d(6) for details  on
       how  to setup a game on a specific host.  If more than one
       game if found, you may pick which game to play in.

       If the --qq flag is given, _h_u_n_t queries  the  local  network
       (or  specific host) and reports on all active games found.
       This is useful  for  shell  startup  scripts,  _e_._g_.  csh's
       .login.

       The  player  name  may be specified on the command line by
       using the --nn option.

       The --cc, --ss, and --ff  options  are  for  entering  the  game
       cloaked, scanning, or flying respectively.

       The  --bb option turns off beeping when you reach the typea-
       head limit.

       The --tt option aids team playing by making everyone else on
       one's team appear as the team name.  A team name is a sin-
       gle digit to avoid conflicting with other characters  used
       in the game.

       The --pp _p_o_r_t option allows the rendezvous port number to be
       set.  This is a useful way for people  playing  on  dialup
       lines to avoid playing with people on 9600 baud terminals.

       The --ww _m_e_s_s_a_g_e option is the only way to send a message to
       everyone  else's  screen  when  you  start up.  It is most
       often used to say ``eat slime death - NickD's coming in''.

       When  you  die  and  are asked if you wish to re-enter the
       game, there are other answers than just yes  or  no.   You
       can also reply with a ww for write a message before contin-
       uing or oo to change how you enter the game (cloaked, scan-
       ning, or flying).

       To  be  notified  automatically when a _h_u_n_t starts up, add
       your  login  to  the  _h_u_n_t_-_p_l_a_y_e_r_s   mailing   list   (see
       _h_u_n_t_d(6)).

PPLLAAYYIINNGG HHIINNTTSS
       _H_u_n_t  only  works  on crt (vdt) terminals with at least 24
       lines, 80 columns, and cursor addressing.  The  screen  is
       divided in to 3 areas.  On the right hand side is the sta-
       tus area.  It shows damage sustained,  charges  remaining,
       who's  in  the game, who's scanning (the ````**'''' in front of
       the name), who's cloaked (the ````++'''' in front of the name),
       and  other  players'  scores.   The  rest of the screen is
       taken up by your map of the maze.  The 24th line  is  used
       for longer messages that don't fit in the status area.

       _H_u_n_t uses the same keys to move as _v_i(1) does, _i_._e_., hh, jj,
       kk, and ll for  left,  down,  up,  right  respectively.   To
       change  which direction you're facing in the maze, use the
       upper case version of the movement key (_i_._e_., HHJJKKLL).   You
       can only fire or throw things in the direction you're fac-
       ing.

       Other commands are:

              f or 1- Fire a bullet (Takes 1 charge)
              g or 2- Throw grenade (Takes 9 charges)
              F or 3- Throw satchel charge (Takes 25 charges)
              G or 4- Throw bomb (Takes 49 charges)
              5     - Throw big bomb (Takes 81 charges)
              6     - Throw even bigger bomb (Takes 121 charges)
              7     - Throw even more big bomb (Takes 169 charges)
              8     - Throw even more bigger bomb (Takes 225 charges)
              9     - Throw very big bomb (Takes 289 charges)
              0     - Throw very, very big bomb (Takes 361 charges)
              @     - Throw biggest bomb (Takes 441 charges)
              o     - Throw small slime (Takes 15 charges)
              O     - Throw big slime (Takes 30 charges)
              p     - Throw bigger slime (Takes 45 charges)
              P     - Throw biggest slime (Takes 60 charges)
              s     - Scan (show where other players are) (Takes 1 charge)
              c     - Cloak (hide from scanners) (Takes 1 charge)

              ^L    - Redraw screen
              q     - Quit

       The symbols on the screen are:

              -|+   - walls
              /\    - diagonal (deflecting) walls
              #     - doors (dispersion walls)
              ;     - small mine
              g     - large mine
              :     - bullet
              o     - grenade
              O     - satchel charge
              @     - bomb
              s     - small slime
              $     - big slime
              ><^v  - you facing right, left, up, or down
              }{i!  - other players facing right, left, up, or down
              *     - explosion
              \|/
              _-_*_-   - grenade and large mine explosion
              /|\

       Other helpful hints:

       [] You can only fire in the direction you are facing.
       [] You can only fire three shots in a row,  then  the  gun
          must cool off.
       [] Shots move 5 times faster than you do.
       [] To stab someone, you face that player and move at them.
       [] Stabbing does 2 points worth  of  damage  and  shooting
          does 5 points.
       [] Slime does 5 points of damage each time it hits.
       [] You  start  with 15 charges and get 5 more every time a
          player enters or re-enters.
       [] Grenade explosions cover a 3 by  3  area,  each  larger
          bomb  cover a correspondingly larger area (ranging from
          5 by 5 to 21  by  21).   All  explosions  are  centered
          around  the square the shot hits and do the most damage
          in the center.
       [] Slime affects all squares it oozes over.  The number of
          squares is equal to the number of charges used.
       [] One small mine and one large mine is placed in the maze
          for every new player.  A mine has a 2%  probability  of
          tripping when you walk forward on to it; 50% when going
          sideways; 95% when backing up.  Tripping a  mine  costs
          you  5  points  or  10 points respectively.  Defusing a
          mine is worth 1 charge or 9 charges respectively.
       [] You cannot see behind you.
       [] Cloaking consumes 1 ammo charge per 20 of your moves.
       [] Scanning consumes 1 ammo charge per (20 x the number of
          players) of other player moves.
       [] Turning  on  cloaking  turns off scanning -- turning on
          scanning turns off cloaking.

       [] When you kill someone, you get 2 more  damage  capacity
          points and 2 damage points get taken away.
       [] Maximum typeahead is 5 characters.
       [] A  shot  destroys normal (_i_._e_._, non-diagonal, non-door)
          walls.
       [] Diagonal walls deflect shots and change orientation.
       [] Doors disperse shots in random  directions  (up,  down,
          left, right).
       [] Diagonal  walls and doors cannot be destroyed by direct
          shots but may  be  destroyed  by  an  adjacent  grenade
          explosion.
       [] Slime goes around walls, not through them.
       [] Walls  regenerate,  reappearing  in the order they were
          destroyed.  One percent of the regenerated  walls  will
          be  diagonal  walls or doors.  When a wall is generated
          directly beneath a player, he is  thrown  in  a  random
          direction  for a random period of time.  When he lands,
          he sustains damage (up to 20 percent of the  amount  of
          damage  already  sustained);  _i_._e_.,  the less damage he
          had, the more nimble he is and therefore less likely to
          hurt himself on landing.
       [] Every  30  deaths or so, a ````??''''  will appear.  It is a
          wandering bomb which will explode when it hits someone,
          or when it is slimed.
       [] If no one moves, everything stands still.
       [] The  environment  variable  HHUUNNTT  is checked to get the
          player name.  If you don't have this variable set, _h_u_n_t
          will  ask you what name you want to play under.  If you
          wish to set other options than just your name, you  can
          enumerate the options as follows:
                    setenv                                   HUNT
          "name=Sneaky,team=1,cloak,mapkey=zoFfGg1f2g3F4G"
          sets the player name to Sneaky, sets the team  to  one,
          sets  the enter game attribute to cloaked, and the maps
          zz to oo, FF to ff, GG to gg, 11 to ff, 22 to gg, 33 to FF,  and  44
          to  GG.   The _m_a_p_k_e_y option must be last.  Other options
          are: scan, fly, nobeep, port=string,  host=string,  and
          message=string  -- which correspond to the command line
          options.  String options cannot  contain  commas  since
          commas are used to separate options.
       [] It's a boring game if you're the only one playing.

       Your  score  is the decayed average of the ratio of number
       of kills to number of times you entered the  game  and  is
       only kept for the duration of a single session of _h_u_n_t.

       _H_u_n_t  normally  drives  up the load average to be approxi-
       mately (number_of_players + 0.5) greater than it would  be
       without a _h_u_n_t game executing.

SSTTAATTIISSTTIICCSS
       The  --SS  option  fetches the current game statistics.  The
       meaning of the column headings are as  follows:  _s_c_o_r_e  --
       the player's last score; _d_u_c_k_e_d -- how many shots a player
       ducked; _a_b_s_o_r_b -- how many shots a player absorbed;  _f_a_c_e_d
       -- how many shots were fired at player's face; _s_h_o_t -- how
       many shots were fired at player; _r_o_b_b_e_d  --  how  many  of
       player's  shots  were  absorbed;  _m_i_s_s_e_d  --  how  many of
       player's shots were ducked; _s_l_i_m_e_K -- how many slime kills
       player  had; _e_n_e_m_y -- how many enemies were killed; _f_r_i_e_n_d
       -- how many friends were  killed  (self  and  same  team);
       _d_e_a_t_h_s  --  how  many times player died; _s_t_i_l_l -- how many
       times player died without typing in any commands; _s_a_v_e_d --
       how  many times a shot/bomb would have killed player if he
       hadn't ducked or absorbed it.
