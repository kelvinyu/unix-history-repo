       _B_i_b  is	a preprocessor for _n_r_o_f_f or _t_r_o_f_f(1) that formats
       citations and bibliographies.  The input	 files	(standard
       input  default)	are copied to the standard output, except
       for text	between	[. and .]  pairs, which	are assumed to be
       keywords	 for  searching	 a  bibliographic database.  If	a
       matching	 reference  is	found  a  citation  is	generated
       replacing  the text.  References	are collected, optionally
       sorted, and written out at a  location  specified  by  the
       user.   Citation	 and  reference	formats	are controlled by
       the -t option.

       Reference databases are created using the _i_n_v_e_r_t	 utility.

       The  following  options are available.  Note that standard
       format styles (see the -t option)  set  options	automati-
       cally.	Thus  if a standard format style is used the user
       need not	indicate any further options for most  documents.

       -aa     reduce authors first names to abbreviations.

       -ar_n_u_m  reverse the first _n_u_m author's names.  If a number
	       is not given all	authors	names are reversed.

       -ax     print authors last names	in Caps-Small Caps style.
	       For example Budd	becomes	BUDD.  This style is used
	       by certain ACM publications.

       -c_s_t_r   build citations according  to  the  template  _s_t_r.
	       See  the	reference format designers guide for more
	       information on templates.

       -d      changes the default  search  directory  for  style
	       files,  include files, etc.  and	changes	the value
	       of the macro BMACLIB for	bib, and of the	macro  l]
	       used  to	 find  the  troff  macro  definition file
	       bmac.std.  Defaults to /usr/new/lib/bmac.  If  you
	       have  your own private copies of	all the	necessary
	       files, using this option	is  the	 easiest  way  to
	       specify them.

       -ea     reduce editors' first names to abbreviations.

       -ex     print editors' last names in Caps-Small Caps style
	       (see -ax	option).

       -er_n_u_m  reverse the first _n_u_m editors' names.  If a number
	       is not given all	editors' names are reversed.

       -f      instead of collecting references, dump each refer-
	       ence immediately	following the line on  which  the
	       citation	 is  placed  (used  for	 footnoted refer-
	       ences).

       -i _f_i_l_e

       -i_f_i_l_e  process the indicated file, such	as a file of def-
	       initions.  (see technical report	for a description
	       of file format).

       -h      replace citations to three or more adjacent refer-
	       ence  items  with  a hyphenated string (eg 2,3,4,5
	       becomes 2-5).  This option implies the -o  option.

       -n_s_t_r   turn  off indicated options.  _s_t_r must be composed
	       of the letters afhosx.

       -o      contiguous citations are	ordered	according the the
	       reference list before being printed (default).

       -p _f_i_l_e

       -p_f_i_l_e  instead	of  searching  the file	INDEX, search the
	       indicated reference  files  before  searching  the
	       system  file.   _f_i_l_e_s is	a comma	separated list of
	       inverted	indices, created using the  _i_n_v_e_r_t  util-
	       ity.

       -s_s_t_r   sort references according to the	template _s_t_r.

       -t _t_y_p_e

       -t_t_y_p_e  use  the	 standard  macros and switch settings for
	       the indicated style to generate citations and ref-
	       erences.	  There	 are  a	number of standard styles
	       provided.  In addition users  can  generate  their
	       own  style macros.  See the format designers guide
	       for details.

       -Tib    the abbreviations and macros used all use the  TiB
	       style  of macro call in which the name is enclosed
	       in vertical |bars|.

       -Tibx   instead of processing the input files,  write  the
	       file  bib.m4.in containing m4(I)	macro definitions
	       that make converting from bib style to  Tib  style
	       macros  a  little  easier.   Note that m4 does not
	       allow ampersands	in macro names:	this file and all
	       of  the	files  to  be  converted  will have to be
	       changed by hand.	 The m4	macros will _o_n_l_y identify

	       words  that  bib	would normally expand: they do no
	       other conversions.  After creating .bib.m4.in, run
	       the scriptfile bib2tib passing it the names of the
	       files you wish converted.

       _L_i_s_t_r_e_f_s	 formats  an  entire  reference	 database   file.
       Options to _l_i_s_t_r_e_f_s are the same	as for _b_i_b.

       _B_i_b_i_n_c  is an od	hack tool for solving the problem of mul-
       tiple define files  for	multiple  styles.   Some  journal
       styles  require	that  journal  names  be spelled out com-
       pletely,	while others allow abbreviated names.  Two  macro
       definition  files are available that allow this multiplic-
       ity of style: bibinc.fullnames and  bibinc.shortnames.	A
       frequent	 source	 of error is updating one of these files,
       and forgetting to update	the other.  _B_i_b_i_n_c allows a  sin-
       gle  file,  say	bibinc.names, to define	both the long and
       the short versions of names, and	from which the files bib-
       inc.fullnames and bibinc.shortnames can easily be created.
       _B_i_b_i_n_c can also be used to define macro files for the  TiB
       bibliographic preprocessor.

       _B_i_b_2_t_i_b will use	the bib.m4.in file created with	the -Tibx
       option to convert any files you specify into one	using the
       TiB-style  macro	 conventions.  It is a simple script that
       does about 95% of the necessary grunge work to  make  this
       conversion,  but	be aware that the user will still need to
       eyeball the converted files for correctness.  To	make  use
       of  the facility, run a _b_i_b job with the	-Tibx option: _b_i_b
       will  not  process  the	input  files,  but  will   create
       bib.m4.in  instead, after gathering together all	the defi-
       nitions it can find. Then for each of  your  bibliographic
       database	files, run _b_i_b_i_n_c.

       _B_i_b  was	 designed  initially for use with the -ms macros,
       and uses	a couple of the	-ms macros (.ip	and .lp)  in  its
       macro  definitions.  To use it with the -me macros, prefix
       the file	being sent  to	nroff/troff  with  the	following
       macro definitions:
		 .de IP
		 .ip \$1 \$2
		 ..
		 .de LP
		 .lp
		 ..

       A  file "bibmac.me" containing these macro definitions may
       be found	in /usr/new/lib/bmac.
