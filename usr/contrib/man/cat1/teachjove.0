       TEACHJOVE  is a simple program that calls up the JOVE edi-
       tor on a special file that is an interactive tutorial  for
       the  JOVE  editor.   Once in JOVE all you do is follow the
       instructions and by doing so  you  will  learn  all  about
       JOVE!   NOTE: TEACHJOVE actually makes a copy of the tuto-
       rial in your home directory; if you  ever  want  to  start
       over  (if  you trash the file by accident) all you need to
       do is remove the file  "~/teach-jove"  and  run  teachjove
       again.
