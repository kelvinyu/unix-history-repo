       _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s is a new version of _E_m_a_c_s_, written by the author
       of the original (PDP-10)  _E_m_a_c_s_,  Richard  Stallman.   Its
       user functionality encompasses everything other _E_m_a_c_s edi-
       tors do, and it is easily  extensible  since  its  editing
       commands are written in Lisp.

       _E_m_a_c_s  has an extensive interactive help facility, but the
       facility assumes that you know  how  to  manipulate  _E_m_a_c_s
       windows  and buffers.  CTRL-h (backspace or CTRL-h) enters
       the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t)  requests  an
       interactive  tutorial which can teach beginners the funda-
       mentals of _E_m_a_c_s in a few minutes.  Help  Apropos  (CTRL-h
       a)  helps you find a command given its functionality, Help
       Character (CTRL-h c) describes a given character's effect,
       and  Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp func-
       tion specified by name.

       _E_m_a_c_s_'_s Undo can undo several  steps  of  modification  to
       your  buffers,  so it is easy to recover from editing mis-
       takes.

       _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s_'_s many  special  packages  handle  mail  reading
       (RMail)  and  sending  (Mail),  outline editing (Outline),
       compiling (Compile), running subshells within  _E_m_a_c_s  win-
       dows  (Shell),  running a Lisp read-eval-print loop (Lisp-
       Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).

       There is an extensive reference manual, but users of other
       Emacses should have little trouble adapting even without a
       copy.  Users new to _E_m_a_c_s will be able to use  basic  fea-
       tures  fairly  rapidly  by studying the tutorial and using
       the self-documentation features.

       Emacs Options

       The following options are of general interest:

       _f_i_l_e    Edit _f_i_l_e_.

       ++_n_u_m_b_e_r Go to the line specified by _n_u_m_b_e_r (do not  insert
               a space between the "+" sign and the number).

       --qq      Do not load an init file.

       --uu _u_s_e_r Load _u_s_e_r_'_s init file.

       --tt _f_i_l_e Use  specified  _f_i_l_e  as  the  terminal instead of
               using stdin/stdout.  This must be the first  argu-
               ment specified in the command line.

       The following options are lisp-oriented (these options are
       processed in the order encountered):

       --ff _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
               Execute the lisp function _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_.

       --ll _f_i_l_e Load the lisp code in the file _f_i_l_e_.

       The following options are useful when running _E_m_a_c_s  as  a
       batch editor:

       --bbaattcchh _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e
               Edit  in  batch  mode  using the commands found in
               _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e_.  The editor  will  send  messages  to
               stdout.   This  option  must  be  the first in the
               argument list.

       --kkiillll   Exit _E_m_a_c_s while in batch mode.

       Using Emacs with X

       _E_m_a_c_s has been tailored to work well  with  the  X  window
       system.   If  you  run _E_m_a_c_s from under X windows, it will
       create its own X window to display in.  You will  probably
       want  to  start the editor as a background process so that
       you can continue using your original window.

       _E_m_a_c_s can be started with the following X switches:

       --rrnn _n_a_m_e
               Specifies the program name which  should  be  used
               when   looking   up   defaults  in  the  user's  X
               resources.  This must be the first  option  speci-
               fied in the command line.

       --wwnn _n_a_m_e
               Specifies the name which should be assigned to the
               _E_m_a_c_s window.

       --rr      Display the _E_m_a_c_s window in reverse video.

       --ii      Use the "kitchen sink" bitmap icon when iconifying
               the _E_m_a_c_s window.

       --ffoonntt _f_o_n_t_, --ffnn _f_o_n_t
               Set  the  _E_m_a_c_s window's font to that specified by
               _f_o_n_t_.  You will find the various _X  fonts  in  the
               _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1_/_f_o_n_t_s  directory.   Note  that  _E_m_a_c_s
               will only accept fixed width fonts.  Under the X11
               Release  4  font-naming conventions, any font with
               the value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of  the
               font  name  is  a  fixed width font.  Furthermore,
               fonts whose name are of the form _w_i_d_t_hx_h_e_i_g_h_t  are
               generally  fixed width, as is the font _f_i_x_e_d.  See
               _x_l_s_f_o_n_t_s(1) for more information.

               When you specify a font, be sure to  put  a  space
               between the switch and the font name.

       --bb _p_i_x_e_l_s
               Set  the _E_m_a_c_s window's border width to the number
               of pixels specified by _p_i_x_e_l_s_.   Defaults  to  one
               pixel on each side of the window.

       --iibb _p_i_x_e_l_s
               Set the window's internal border width to the num-
               ber of pixels specified by  _p_i_x_e_l_s_.   Defaults  to
               one pixel of padding on each side of the window.


       --ww _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y_, --ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
               Set the _E_m_a_c_s window's width, height, and position
               as specified.  The geometry  specification  is  in
               the  standard X format; see _X(1) for more informa-
               tion.  The width and height are specified in char-
               acters; the default is 80 by 24.


       --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
               On color displays, sets the color of the text.

               See  the  file  _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1_/_r_g_b_._t_x_t for a list of
               valid color names.

       --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
               On color displays, sets the color of the  window's
               background.

       --bbdd _c_o_l_o_r

               Create the _E_m_a_c_s window on the  display  specified
               by  _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_n_a_m_e.   Must be the first option speci-
               fied in the command line.

       --nnww     Tells _E_m_a_c_s not to use its special interface to X.
               If you use this switch when invoking _E_m_a_c_s from an
               _x_t_e_r_m(1) window, display is done in  that  window.
               This  must  be  the  first option specified in the
               command line.

       You can set _X default values for  your  _E_m_a_c_s  windows  in
       your  _._X_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s  file  (see _x_r_d_b(1)).  Use the following
       format:

              emacs.keyword:value

       where _v_a_l_u_e specifies the default value of _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_.  _E_m_a_c_s
       lets you set default values for the following keywords:

       ffoonntt ((class FFoonntt))
               Sets the window's text font.

       rreevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo ((class RReevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo))
               If  _r_e_v_e_r_s_e_V_i_d_e_o_'_s  value is set to _o_n_, the window
               will be displayed in reverse video.

       If you try to set color values while  using  a  black  and
       white  display,  the window's characteristics will default
       as follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the
       background  color  will  be set to white, the border color
       will be set to grey, and the text and mouse  cursors  will
       be set to black.

       /usr/local/emacs/shortnames - facilities  for  translating
       long  names  to short names in C code, needed for building
       Emacs on certain versions of Unix  where  the  C  compiler
       cannot handle long names for functions or variables.

BBUUGGSS
       There  is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on
       the  internet   (ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs   on
       UUCPnet),  for reporting Emacs bugs and fixes.  But before
       reporting something as a bug, please try to be  sure  that
       it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate
       feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs
       Bugs''  near the end of the reference manual (or Info sys-
       tem) for hints on how and  when  to  report  bugs.   Also,
       include the version number of the Emacs you are running in
       _e_v_e_r_y bug report that you send in.

       Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The pur-
       pose  of  reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone
       in the next release, if  possible.   For  personal  assis-
       tance,  look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of
       people who offer it.

       Please do not send anything but bug reports to this  mail-
       ing  list.   Send requests to be added to mailing lists to
       the  special  list  info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu
       (or the corresponding UUCP address).  For more information
       about    Emacs    mailing    lists,    see    the     file
       /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS.   Bugs tend actually to
       be fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your  inter-
       est  to  report them in such a way that they can be easily
       reproduced.

       Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with  pro-
       grams running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.

       anyone under the terms stated in the _E_m_a_c_s General  Public
       License,  a  copy  of which accompanies each copy of _E_m_a_c_s
       and which also appears in the reference manual.

       Copies of _E_m_a_c_s may sometimes be  received  packaged  with
       distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
       the scope of any license  covering  those  systems.   Such
       inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is per-
       mitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the General  Pub-
       lic License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other
       restrictions to redistribution of _E_m_a_c_s_.

       Richard Stallman encourages  you  to  improve  and  extend
       _E_m_a_c_s_,  and  urges  that you contribute your extensions to
       the GNU library.  Eventually GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) will  be
       a  complete  replacement for Berkeley Unix.  Everyone will
       be able to use the GNU system for free.
