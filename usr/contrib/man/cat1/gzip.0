       _G_z_i_p  reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
       coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced
       by  one with the extension ..zz,, while keeping the same own-
       ership modes, access and modification times.  (The  exten-
       sion  is  --zz for VMS, zz for MSDOS, OS/2 and Atari.)  If no
       files are specified, the standard input is  compressed  to
       the  standard  output.  If  the new file name is too long,
       _g_z_i_p truncates it and keeps the original file name in  the
       compressed file.  _G_z_i_p will only attempt to compress regu-
       lar files.  In particular, it will ignore symbolic  links.

       Compressed  files  can  be restored to their original form
       using _g_z_i_p _-_d or _g_u_n_z_i_p or _z_c_a_t_.

       _g_u_n_z_i_p takes a list of  files  on  its  command  line  and
       replaces each file whose name ends with ..zz or ..ZZ or --zz and
       which begins with the correct magic number with an  uncom-
       pressed  file without the original extension.  _g_u_n_z_i_p also
       recognizes the special extensions ..ttggzz and ..ttaazz as  short-
       hands for ..ttaarr..zz or ..ttaarr..ZZ

       _g_u_n_z_i_p  can  currently  decompress  files created by _g_z_i_p_,
       _z_i_p_, _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s or _p_a_c_k_.  The detection of the input  format
       is  automatic.   When  using the first two formats, _g_u_n_z_i_p
       checks a 32 bit CRC. For _p_a_c_k_, _g_u_n_z_i_p  checks  the  uncom-
       pressed  length.  The  _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s format was not designed to
       allow consistency checks. However _g_u_n_z_i_p is sometimes able
       to  detect  a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncom-
       pressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is cor-
       rect  simply because the standard _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s does not com-
       plain. This generally means that the  standard  _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s
       does  not  check  its input, and happily generates garbage
       output.

       Files created by _z_i_p can be uncompressed by gzip  only  if
       they  have a single member compressed with the 'deflation'
       method. This feature is only intended to  help  conversion
       of tar.zip files to the tar.z format. To extract zip files
       with several members, use _u_n_z_i_p instead of _g_u_n_z_i_p_.

       _z_c_a_t is identical to _g_u_n_z_i_p --cc..  (On  some  systems,  _z_c_a_t
       may be installed as _g_z_c_a_t to preserve the original link to

       _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_._)  _z_c_a_t uncompresses either a list  of  files  on
       the  command  line  or  its  standard input and writes the
       uncompressed data on standard output.   _z_c_a_t  will  uncom-
       press  files  that  have  the correct magic number whether
       they have a ..zz suffix or not.

       _G_z_i_p uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in _z_i_p and  PKZIP.
       The  amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
       the input and the distribution of common substrings.  Typ-
       ically,  text such as source code or English is reduced by
       60-70%.  Compression is generally much  better  than  that
       achieved  by LZW (as used in _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s), Huffman coding (as
       used in _p_a_c_k), or adaptive Huffman coding (_c_o_m_p_a_c_t).

       Compression is always performed, even  if  the  compressed
       file  is slightly larger than the original. The worst case
       expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus  5
       bytes every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for
       large files.   _g_z_i_p  preserves  the  mode,  ownership  and
       timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.

              the  output consists of a sequence of independently
              compressed members. To obtain  better  compression,

              running  in  the background, _g_z_i_p prompts to verify
              whether an existing file should be overwritten.

              --99  or  ----bbeesstt  indicates  the  slowest compression

       Multiple  compressed  files  can  be concatenated. In this
       case, _g_u_n_z_i_p will extract all members at once.  For  exam-
       ple:

             gzip -c file1  > foo.z
             gzip -c file2 >> foo.z Then
             gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

             cat file1 file2

       In  case  of damage to one member of a .z file, other mem-
       bers can still be recovered  (if  the  damaged  member  is
       removed).  However, you can get better compression by com-
       pressing all members at once:

             cat file1 file2 | gzip > foo.z

       compresses better than

             gzip -c file1 file2 > foo.z

       The  environment  variable  GGZZIIPP can hold a set of default
       options for _g_z_i_p_.  These options are interpreted first and
       can  be  overwritten  by explicit command line parameters.
       For example:

             for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8 -v"
             for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8 -v
