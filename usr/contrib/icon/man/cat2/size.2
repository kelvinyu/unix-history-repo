     The procedure SSSSiiiizzzzeeee((((xxxx)))) produces the size, in bytes, of xxxx.

     There is an optional second argument, which specifies the
     machine word size, in bits. For example, SSSSiiiizzzzeeee((((xxxx,,,,11116666)))) produces
     the size of xxxx on a 16-bit machine. Only word sizes of 16 and
     32 are supported; the default, in the absence of the second
     argument, is 32.

     The sizes given are approximate for many objects. The fol-
     lowing interpretations are made in determining sizes:

       Strings are counted as distinct; no allowance is made for
       shared usage of storage.

       The size of procedures may be underestimated.

       The size of co-expressions is approximate and does not
       take into account space for the local identifiers and
       related information.

       The size of lists that are augmented by stack and queue
       functions may be underestimated.

       Sizes are based on parameters as given in the Icon system
       as it is distributed; local changes may affect the sizes
       of some objects.
