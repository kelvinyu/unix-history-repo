.SH NAME
i-trfil \- Icon trace filter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3i-trfil\fP [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fII-trfil\fP filters standard input using user-designated
strings as keys.
.PP
The following options may appear more than once and in any order:
.IP \f3+\fP\fIstring\fP 0.75i
Consider only lines containing \fIstring\fP; otherwise all lines are considered.
.IP \f3^\fP\fIstring\fP 
Remove lines containing \fIstring\fP from consideration (except those containing
a string specified by the \f3!\fR option).
.IP \f3!\fP\fIstring\fP
Retain lines containing \fIstring\fP.
.IP \f3\-c\fP\fIn\fP
Print \fIn\fP context lines before (if \fIn\fP is negative) or after (if
\fIn\fP is positive). Nonsequential context lines are separated by a
blank line. The default is 0.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Trace output from Icon programs goes to standard error output, which
cannot be piped directly into \fIi-trfil\fR. This problem can be
circumvented by combining output streams. In \fIsh(1)\fR, this
can be accomplished by
.DS
prog 2>&1 | i-trfil ...
.DE
while in \fIcsh(1)\fR, it can be accomplished by
.DS
prog |& i-trfil ...
.DE
.SH BUG
If the environment variable \f3TRACE\fR is set to a nonzero value when
\fIi-trfil\fR is running, one line of tracing is produced from
\fIi-trfil\fR in addition to any other tracing.
