.SH NAME
i-xref \- Icon program cross reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3i-xref\fP [file] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fII-xref\fP provides a cross-reference facility for Icon programs. It lists
the occurrences of each variable by line number. Variables are listed
by procedure or separately as globals.
The options specify the formatting of the
output and whether or not to cross-reference quoted strings and
non-alphanumerics. Variables that are followed by a left parenthesis
are listed with an asterisk following the name.
If a file is not specified, then standard input is cross-referenced.
.PP
The following options change the format defaults. They may appear in any order:
.IP "\f3\-c\fP \fIn\fP" 0.75i
The column width per line number. The default is 4 columns wide.
.IP "\f3\-l\fP \fIn\fP"
The starting column (i.e. left margin) of the line numbers.
The default is column 40.
.IP "\f3\-w\fP \fIn\fP"
The column width of the whole output line. The default is 80 columns wide.
.PP
Normally only alphanumerics are cross-referenced. These options expand
what is considered:
.IP \f3\-q\fP 0.75i
Include quoted strings.
.IP \f3\-x\fP
Include all non-alphanumerics.

.SH LIMITATION
This program assumes the subject file is a valid Icon program. For example,
quotes are expected to be matched.
