.SH NAME
gcomp \- global complement of file names
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3gcomp\fP files
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGcomp\fR produces a list of the files in the current directory
that do not appear among the arguments.
For example,
.DS
gcomp *.c
.DE
produces a list of files in the current directory that do not
end in \*M.c\fR.
As another example, to remove all the files in the current directory
that do not match \*MMakefile\fR, \*M*.c\fR, or \*M*.h\fR, the
following can be used:
.DS
rm `gcomp Makefile *.c *.h`
.DE
The files \*M.\fR and \*M..\fR are not included in the output, but other
`dot files' are.
.SH BUGS
\fIGcomp\fR reads the current directory as a file and assumes that all
directory entires are 16 bytes in length.
