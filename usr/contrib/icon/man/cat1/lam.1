     _L_a_m laminates the named files onto the standard output.  The
     resulting output is the line-by-line concatenation of
     corresponding lines from each file named.  If the files are
     different lengths, empty lines are substituted for missing
     lines in the shorter files.

     Each _s_t_r_i_n_g argument is placed in the output line at the
     point that it appears in the argument list.  For example,
     lines from _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 can be laminated with a colon
     between each line from _f_i_l_e_1 and the corresponding line from
     _f_i_l_e_2 by the command

          lam file1 -: file2


     Filenames and strings may appear in any order in the argu-
     ment list.  If `-', is given for a filename the standard
     input is read at that point.  If a file is named more than
     once, each of its lines will be duplicated on the output
     line, except that if standard input is named more than once,
     its lines will be read alternately.  For example, each pair
     of lines from standard input can be joined onto one line
     with a space between them by the command

          lam - "- " -


     while the command

          lam file1 "- " file1


     replicates each line from _f_i_l_e_1.
