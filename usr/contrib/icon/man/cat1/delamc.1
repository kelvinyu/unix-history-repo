     _D_e_l_a_m_c delaminates an input file into several output files
     according to the separator characters specified by the cccchhhhaaaarrrrssss
     argument following the ----tttt flag.  _D_e_l_a_m_c reads iiiinnnnffffiiiilllleeee and
     writes the fields in each line to the corresponding output
     files as individual lines. If no data occurs in the speci-
     fied position for a given input line an empty output line is
     written. This insures that all output files contain the same
     number of lines as the input file.

     If `-' is used for iiiinnnnffffiiiilllleeee, the standard input is read.  If
     `-' is used as an output file name, the corresponding field
     is written to the standard output. If the ----tttt flag is not
     used, an ascii horizontal tab character is assumed as the
     default field separator.

     The use of _d_e_l_a_m_c is illustrated by the following examples.

          delamc tst.asm labels opcodes operands

     reads the file _t_s_t._a_s_m and writes the fields, each of which
     is separated by a tab character, to the output files _l_a_b_e_l_s,
     _o_p_c_o_d_e_s, and _o_p_e_r_a_n_d_s.

          delamc -t: scores names matric ps1 ps2 ps3

     reads the file _s_c_o_r_e_s and writes the fields, each of which
     is separated by a colon, to the indicated output files.

          delamc -t,:; oldata f1 f2

     reads the file _o_l_d_a_t_a and separates the fields using either
     a comma, a colon, or a semicolon.

     The functionality of the Software Tools _d_e_l_a_m has been
     divided. _D_e_l_a_m_c differs from the Tools syntax by allowing a
     set of separation characters to be specified.
