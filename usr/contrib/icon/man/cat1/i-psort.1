     _I-_p_s_o_r_t reads an Icon program from standard input and writes
     an equivalent program to standard output with the procedures
     sorted alphabetically. Global, external, and record declara-
     tions come first in the order they appear in the original
     program.  The main procedure comes next followed by the
     remaining procedures in alphabetical order.

     Comments and white space between declarations are attached
     to the next following declaration.
