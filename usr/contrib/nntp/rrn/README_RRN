Hacks to change rn into rrn		31 August 1985

     The following steps should be followed to set up "rrn" on
your system.  The files in this directory are somewhat modified
versions of those distributed with normal rn 4.3.  However, some
things were overly-difficult to change, and you will have to
hack them in by hand later.  Fortunately, that's mostly
trivial.

     1. Run "Configure", as usual.  However, make one change --
	make your news spool directory be "/tmp", instead of
	whatever it would normally be.

     2. Edit the file "config.h".  Append two lines to the end of
	the file:

	#define SERVER
	#define SERVER_HOST	"xxx"

	The first line tells the compiler that you want the
	remote news reading hacks compiled in.  The second
	tells it that the host to query for news and to send
	posted articles to is "xxx".  Obviously, "xxx" should be
	changed to whatever machine name is apropriate.
	
     3. Type "make"...
