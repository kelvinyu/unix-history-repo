     The Versatec printer/plotter is normally used with the line
     printer system.  This description is designed for those who
     wish to drive the Versatec directly.

     To use the Versatec yourself, you must realize that you can-
     not open the device, /_d_e_v/_v_p_0 if there is a daemon active.
     You can see if there is a daemon active by doing a _l_p_q(1),
     and seeing if there are any files being sent.  Printing
     should be turned off using _l_p_c(8).

     To set the Versatec into plot mode you should include
     <_s_y_s/_v_c_m_d._h> and use the _i_o_c_t_l(2) call

	  ioctl(fileno(vp), VSETSTATE, plotmd);

     where _p_l_o_t_m_d is defined to be

	  iinntt plotmd[] = { VPLOT, 0, 0 };

     and _v_p is the result of a call to _f_o_p_e_n on stdio.	When you
     finish using the Versatec in plot mode you should eject
     paper by sending it a EOT after putting it back into print
     mode, i.e. by

	  iinntt prtmd[] = { VPRINT, 0, 0 };
	  ...
	  fflush(vp);
	  ioctl(fileno(vp), VSETSTATE, prtmd);
	  write(fileno(vp), "\04", 1);

     The following error numbers are significant at the time the
     device is opened.

     [ENXIO]   The device is already in use.

     [EIO]     The device is offline.

BBUUGGSS
     The configuration part of the driver assumes that the device
     is set up to vector print mode through 0174 and plot mode
     through 0200.  As the configuration program can't be sure
     which vector interrupted at boot time, we specify that it
     has two interrupt vectors, and if an interrupt comes through
     0200 it is reset to 0174.	This is safe for devices with one
     or two vectors at these two addresses.  Other configurations
     with 2 vectors may require changes in the driver.
