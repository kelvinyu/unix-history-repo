     _M_e_m is a special file that is an image of the main memory of
     the computer.  It may be used, for example, to examine (and
     even to patch) the system.

     Byte addresses in _m_e_m are interpreted as physical memory
     addresses.  References to non-existent locations cause
     errors to be returned.

     Examining and patching device registers is likely to lead to
     unexpected results when read-only or write-only bits are
     present.

     The file _k_m_e_m is the same as _m_e_m except that kernel virtual
     memory rather than physical memory is accessed.

     The file _v_m_e_m allows access to the mapped portion of the
     VERSAbus i/o space.  On the Tahoe the upper megabyte of the
     physical address space is accessible through this file
     (0xfff00000 through 0xffffffff). Accesses to the upper 64
     kilobytes of the i/o space result in VERSAbus transfers with
     a 16-bit address (the offset in this region) and a ``non-
     privileged short i/o'' VERSAbus address modifier.	Accesses
     to the remainder of the mapped region, result in VERSAbus
     transfers with a 24-bit address and a ``non-privileged stan-
     dard'' VERSAbus address modifier.	This region is actually
     part of the region between 0xfeff0000 and 0xffff0000 which
     generates VERSAbus transfers with a 24-bit address.
     Accesses to the remainder of the one gigabyte i/o space gen-
     erate transfers that utilize a 32-bit address with a ``non-
     privileged extended'' address modifier.  Any 32-bit address
     generated by a cpu access to this part of the i/o space have
     the upper two bits zero; thus, for example, an access to
     physical address 0xfe000000 causes the address 0x3e000000 to
     be supplied in the resultant VERSAbus read/write cycle.

     On the Tahoe, the per-process data for the current process
     begins at virtual address 0xbffff000.

     Memory files are accessed one byte at a time, an inappropi-
     ate method for some device registers.
