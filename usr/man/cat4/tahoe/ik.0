     The _i_k driver provides access to an Evans and Sutherland
     Picture System 300 through an Ikon DR-11W interface card.
     Each two minor device numbers are a different PS300; within
     a pair of device numbers the odd valued device is used for
     ``diagnostic'' purposes.	That is, for even numbered minor
     devices, opening the device results in a PS300 ``attach''
     request being performed while for odd numbered minor devices
     the attach request is not performed.

     All operations between the host and the PS300 utilize DMA.
     The driver currently supports only ``physical i/o'' opera-
     tions when reading and writing; this makes the device use-
     less with standard Evans and Sutherland software.

     The interface provided by the interface is as UNIX-like as
     possible.	When a device is opened a PS300 attach request is
     automatically performed.  When a device is closed a detach
     is performed.  Reads and writes result in physical i/o
     requests, but hide all the details of the physical i/o pro-
     tocol.  This is programming style is completely different
     from the VMS-oriented qio-style interface supplied by Evans
     and Sutherland.

     Reads and writes to the device result in a physical i/o
     request to the PS300.  If a _r_e_a_d_v(2) or _w_r_i_t_e_v(2) call is
     used, each i/o request results in a single physical i/o
     request (i.e. the scatter-gather facilities are not sup-
     ported).  In normal operation, the address used in a physi-
     cal i/o request is the current file offset as specified
     explicitly with _l_s_e_e_k(2) or implictly as a result of reading
     or writing the device.  To specify an address to be used
     with each physical i/o request, the _i_k driver interprets the
     _i_o_v entries in a non-standard way.  If _i_o_v__l_e_n is zero, then
     _i_o_v__b_a_s_e is interpreted as an address to be used in the phy-
     sical i/o request.  If the address has the PSIO_SYNC flag
     or-d into it, the physical i/o request is made as a ``write
     with sync''.  All addresses and data presented to the driver
     should be in the byte order of the host; any byte swapping
     required to converse with the PS300 is performed in the
     driver/controller.

     In addition to reading and writing, the following _i_o_c_t_l
     requests are available:

     PSIOLOOKUP
	  Perform a ``name lookup'' request.  The _p_s_l_o_o_k_u_p struc-
	  ture passed indicates the symbol name to be looked up
	  and contains the address returned by the PS300.  A zero
	  address return indicates the symbol was undefined.

     PSIOGETERROR
	  In the event of an error, this request may be made to
	  return a more detailed and, sometimes PS300-specific,
	  error code.

BBUUGGSS
     An invalid access (e.g. illegal address) to the PS300 can
     cause the PS300 to crash.	It is not always possible to
     unwedge the PS300 interface hardware hung by an i/o request.
