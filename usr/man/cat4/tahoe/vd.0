     This is a generic VERSAbus storage module disk driver for
     the Computer Consoles SMD (VDDC) and SMD-E disk controllers.

     Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various
     portions of drive 0; minor devices 8 through 15 refer to
     drive 1, etc.  The standard device names begin with ``dk''
     followed by the drive number and then a letter a-h for par-
     titions 0-7 respectively.	The character ? stands here for a
     drive number in the range 0-7.

     The block files access the disk via the system's normal
     buffering mechanism and may be read and written without
     regard to physical disk records.  There is also a `raw'
     interface which provides for direct transmission between the
     disk and the user's read or write buffer.	A single read or
     write call results in exactly one I/O operation, and there-
     fore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when many words
     are transmitted.  The names of the raw files conventionally
     begin with an extra `r.'

     In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 1024 bytes,
     whether the actual sector size is 512 or 1024 bytes.  Like-
     wise, _s_e_e_k calls should specify a multiple of 1024 bytes.

     The first sector of each disk contains a disk label contain-
     ing geometry information and partition layouts (see _d_i_s_k_l_a_-
     _b_e_l(5).  This sector is normally write-protected, and disk-
     to-disk copies should avoid copying this sector.  The label
     may be updated with _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l(8), which can also be used to
     write-enable and write-disable the sector.

     During autoconfiguration, as well as when a drive is opened
     after all partitions are closed, the first sector of the
     drive is examined for a disk label.  If a label is found,
     the geometry of the drive and the partition tables are taken
     from it.  If no label is found, The driver checks for a disk
     label on sector 0 of each drive during autoconfiguration.
     If no label is found, the driver tries to access the last
     track on each drive to determine the type of drive attached.
     The driver has default partition tables for seven different
     drives: CDC FSD (160 MB), CDC 9766 (300 MB), CDC XFSD (340
     MB), CDC 515MB, Fujitsu 360 MB, Fujitsu Eagle (440 MB), and
     Maxtor 340Mb.  If the drive is not recognized, a single

     small partition is created to allow a label to be written.

     The partition tables in the disk label and the _d_i_s_k_t_a_b file
     specify partition offsets and sizes in sectors, which are
     512 bytes on SMD drives and 1024 bytes on 5 1/4" ESDI
     drives.  By convention, the ?a partition is normally used
     for the root file system or other small file system, and the
     ?b partition is used as a paging area.  The ?c partition
     maps the rest of the pack, except the last 5 cylinders which
     are reserved for bad sector forwarding, and diagnostic use.
