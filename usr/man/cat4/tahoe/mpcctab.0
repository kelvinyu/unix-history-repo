     mpcctab - MPCC configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file mmppccccttaabb is used to configure CCI's Multi-Protocol
     Communication Controller (MPCC).  The controller provides
     high-speed synchronous communications for the POWER 6 family
     of computers.  This file determines the MPCC board confi-
     gurations. You can download either a synchronous , bisync or
     an asynchronous protocol to an MPCC board.  See _d_l_m_p_c_c(8)
     for details.

     A mmppccccttaabb file is supplied with each MPCC release; however,
     you can modify this file or create your own file by using
     one of the UNIX text editors.

     The contents of the file consists of entries that describe
     supported communication protocols and their unique attri-
     butes. The protocols supported are X.25, SNA,  ASYNC, and
     BISYNC.  For ASYNC two different entries are possible in the
     _p_r_o_c_o_l field - if 16 port MPCC async is configured, then
     ASYNC is entered; 32 port MPCC async is specified by enter-
     ing 32PORT.  This file must reside in the directory
     //eettcc//mmppcccc.

EEnnttrryy LLiinnee FFoorrmmaatt
     An entry line consists of an _i_t_e_m _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r followed by
     variable width arguments separated by colons. There are
     three item identifiers: MPCC, PROTOCOL, PORT. The MPCC line
     in this file identifies the board number. The PROTOCOL line
     identifies the specific communication protocol.  The PORT
     line describes the port for the immediately preceding proto-
     col. The number of arguments  for the PROTOCOL and PORT
     lines, and the arguments themselves, are protocol dependent.
     See the individual argument descriptions for details.

     Notes: Use upper case letters for clarity when specifying
     the item identifier and the protocol name. Make sure that
     you enter the argument values in the order specified below.
     Also, use comments liberally, and indicate comment lines by
     placing a pound sign (##) in column one.

     The item identifiers and their corresponding line formats,
     with valid argument values, follow:

     Argument Explanations:

	  _b_d_n_o	  Specifies the board number.

	  FFCCCCSS	  FCCS is a fault-tolerant support system that
		  allows backup ports to assume the functions of
		  failed ports.  For example, if port 0 fails for
		  any reason, another port may be configured to
		  assume the duties of the failed port.  The key-
		  word FFCCCCSS identifies this feature and must be
		  followed by the list of fail-safe port numbers
		  and a time increment, described below.  This
		  feature is optional.

	  SSOOCC	  An FCCS port can also be an SOC (Switch On
		  Close) port, meaning that the port will switch
		  when it is closed.  And as with FCCS, the port
		  will switch if it fails.  This feature is
		  optional.

	  _p_o_r_t_n_o  Portno is a list of port numbers, separated by
		  commas, specifying the primary ports you want
		  protected by backup ports.  FCCS boards have
		  either 4 primary and 4 backup ports, or 8 pri-
		  mary and 8 backup ports.  The valid port
		  numbers are 00 through 33 for the 4-port version,
		  and 00 through 77 for the 8-port version.

		  Each of the ports has a switched connector.  If
		  the board fails for any reason, the traffic on
		  these ports is automatically routed through the
		  switched connector.  These connectors must be
		  cabled to secondary ports on the other FCCS
		  connector panels.  The secondary ports are num-
		  bered 8 through 11 on the 4-port version and 8
		  through 15 on the 8-port version.  Only the
		  primary ports need be designated in the FCCS
		  configuration line, however all ports must be
		  identified as described in the PORT Line sec-
		  tion below.

	  _t_i_m_e	  Specifies the time period for the sentinel
		  relay timer. Each board resets its sentinel
		  timer after the specified time period. If the
		  board fails, and therefore can't set the timer,
		  then control is passed automatically to another
		  board, which continues the current processing.
		  This feature ensures PerpetualProcessing and is
		  transparent to the user. The valid range of
		  values in milliseconds is from 5500 to 55995500 in 50
		  millisecond increments.

		    specified board.

	  _p_r_o_c_o_l    Specifies the protocol. You must state the

		      allocated for S/U frames.

	  _i_r_e_c_v_b_u_f    Specifies the number of receive buffers
		      allocated for I frames.

	  _s_u_r_e_c_v_b_u_f   Specifies the number of receive buffers
		      allocated for S/U frames.

	  _x_m_i_t_o       Specifies the Level 1 transmit timeout.
		      This argument should be 00 so that Level 1
		      calculates timeout from the baud rate.

	  _r_t_s	      Specifies the modem control value for rts.
		      Valid values are 11 which equals aasssseerrtt, 22
		      which equals ddrroopp, and 33 which equals aauuttoo.

	  _d_t_r	      Specifies the modem control value for dtr.
		      Valid values are 11 which equals aasssseerrtt, and
		      22 which equals ddrroopp.

	  _l_i_n_e_i_d_l_e    Specifies the line state between transmis-
		      sions. Valid values are 00 which specifies a
		      flag fill, and 11 which specifies a mark
		      fill.

	  _r_c_v_a_d_r      Specifies the port configuration. A 11 makes
		      the port a DCE, while a 33 makes the port a
		      DTE.

	  _m_a_s_k	      Specifies the data link receive mask. This
		      argument must be 33.

	  _x_m_t_r_t_y      Specifies the number of data link retries
		      after a transmit timeout. This argument
		      should be zero since upper levels of X25 do
		      retries.

	  _b_a_u_d	      Specifies the baud rate of a transmission.
		      All standard rates are supported. Some com-
		      mon rate values are 00 equals a modem, 1133
		      equals 9600, and 2266 equals 56KB. See the
		      header file mmpp__ppoorrtt..hh for other values.

	  _e_n_c_o_d_e      Specifies the physical data encoding. A 00
		      indicates NRZ, and a 11 indicates NRZI.

	  _t_r_a_c_e       Specifies the data link receive trace mode.
		      This argument must be 00.
