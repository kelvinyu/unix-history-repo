The year, month and day may be omitted, the current
values being the defaults.
The system operates in GMT.
.I Date

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
`No permission' if
you aren't the super-user and you try to change the date;
`bad conversion' if the date set is syntactically incorrect.
.SH BUGS
The system attempts to keep the date in a format closely compatible
with VMS.  VMS, however, uses local time (rather than GMT) and does
not understand daylight savings time.  Thus if you use both UNIX
and VMS, VMS will be running on GMT.
