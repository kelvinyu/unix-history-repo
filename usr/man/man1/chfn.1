.TH CHFN 1 "17 March 1982 deprecated"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
chfn \- change full name of user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chfn
name
string
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Chfn
is a command similar to
.IR passwd (1)
except that it is used to change the gcos field of the password
file rather than the password entry.
Note that the string specified will replace the entire gecos field of the
specified user.
If (as on the UCB system) this field contains information in addition
to the user's full name, this information must be included in string
or it will be deleted.
Hence chfn can be used to fix phone numbers, offices, etc.
.PP
An example use of this command would be
.PP
.DT
	chfn mark \'& Horton,508E,7686,5240633\'
.PP
Note that the string must in general be quoted to shield blanks
and special characters from the shell.
The field should consist of the users name,
followed by their office number,
followed by the last 4 digits of their office extension
and finally their home phone number.
Any of these can be omitted.
At UCB, offices can be given as ``508E'' for 508 Evans, and ``187MC'' for
187M Cory.
There should be no spaces in the entry except for those in your name.
.PP
It is a good idea to run 
.IR finger (1)
on the user before and after
.I chfn
to make sure you have formatted the data correctly.
.SH SEE\ ALSO
finger(1), passwd(5), chsh(1), passwd(1)

.SH BUGS
The encoding of the office and extension information is installation dependent.
.PP
A new user-information data base is in the works which will supplant
this program;
.I chfn's
days are numbered.
