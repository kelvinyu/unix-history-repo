     _S_i_g_p_a_u_s_e assigns _s_i_g_m_a_s_k to the set of masked signals and
     then waits for a signal to arrive; on return the set of
     masked signals is restored.  _S_i_g_m_a_s_k is usually 0 to indi-
     cate that no signals are now to be blocked.  _S_i_g_p_a_u_s_e always
     terminates by being interrupted, returning -1 with _e_r_r_n_o set
     to EINTR.

     In normal usage, a signal is blocked using _s_i_g_b_l_o_c_k(2), to
     begin a critical section, variables modified on the
     occurrence of the signal are examined to determine that
     there is no work to be done, and the process pauses awaiting
     work by using _s_i_g_p_a_u_s_e with the mask returned by _s_i_g_b_l_o_c_k.
