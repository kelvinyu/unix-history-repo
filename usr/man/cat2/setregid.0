     The real and effective group ID's of the current process are
     set to the arguments.  Unprivileged users may change the
     real group ID to the effective group ID and vice-versa; only
     the super-user may make other changes.

     Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective
     group ID forces the system to substitute the current ID in
     place of the -1 parameter.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EPERM]	    The current process is not the super-user and
		    a change other than changing the effective
		    group-id to the real group-id was specified.
