     The first form of _f_s_c_k preens a standard set of filesystems
     or the specified file systems.  It is normally used in the
     script //eettcc//rrcc during automatic reboot.  In this case _f_s_c_k
     reads the table //eettcc//ffssttaabb to determine which file systems
     to check.	It uses the information there to inspect groups
     of disks in parallel taking maximum advantage of i/o overlap
     to check the file systems as quickly as possible.	Normally,
     the root file system will be checked on pass 1, other
     ``root'' (``a'' partition) file systems on pass 2, other
     small file systems on separate passes (e.g. the ``d'' file
     systems on pass 3 and the ``e'' file systems on pass 4), and
     finally the large user file systems on the last pass, e.g.
     pass 5.  Only partitions in fstab that are mounted ``rw'' or
     ``rq'' and that have non-zero pass number are checked.

     The system takes care that only a restricted class of inno-
     cuous inconsistencies can happen unless hardware or software
     failures intervene.  These are limited to the following:

	  Unreferenced inodes

	  Link counts in inodes too large

	  Missing blocks in the free map

	  Blocks in the free map also in files

	  Counts in the super-block wrong

     These are the only inconsistencies that _f_s_c_k with the --pp
     option will correct; if it encounters other inconsistencies,
     it exits with an abnormal return status and an automatic
     reboot will then fail.  For each corrected inconsistency one
     or more lines will be printed identifying the file system on
     which the correction will take place, and the nature of the
     correction.  After successfully correcting a file system,
     _f_s_c_k will print the number of files on that file system, the
     number of used and free blocks, and the percentage of frag-
     mentation.

     If sent a QUIT signal, _f_s_c_k will finish the file system
     checks, then exit with an abnormal return status that causes
     the automatic reboot to fail.  This is useful when you wish

     to finish the file system checks, but do not want the
     machine to come up multiuser.

     Without the --pp option, _f_s_c_k audits and interactively repairs
     inconsistent conditions for file systems. If the file system
     is inconsistent the operator is prompted for concurrence
     before each correction is attempted.  It should be noted
     that some of the corrective actions which are not correct-
     able under the --pp option will result in some loss of data.
     The amount and severity of data lost may be determined from
     the diagnostic output.  The default action for each con-
     sistency correction is to wait for the operator to respond
     yyeess or nnoo.  If the operator does not have write permission
     on the file system _f_s_c_k will default to a --nn action.

     _F_s_c_k has more consistency checks than its predecessors
     _c_h_e_c_k, _d_c_h_e_c_k, _f_c_h_e_c_k, and _i_c_h_e_c_k combined.

     The following flags are interpreted by _f_s_c_k.

     --bb    Use the block specified immediately after the flag as
	   the super block for the file system.  Block 32 is usu-
	   ally an alternate super block.

     --yy    Assume a yes response to all questions asked by _f_s_c_k;
	   this should be used with great caution as this is a
	   free license to continue after essentially unlimited
	   trouble has been encountered.

     --nn    Assume a no response to all questions asked by _f_s_c_k;
	   do not open the file system for writing.

     --cc    If the file system is in the old (static table) for-
	   mat, convert it to the new (dynamic table) format.  If
	   the file system is in the new format, convert it to
	   the old format provided the old format can support the
	   filesystem configuration.  In interactive mode, _f_s_c_k
	   will list the direction the conversion is to be made
	   and ask whether the conversion should be done.  If a
	   negative answer is given, no further operations are
	   done on the filesystem.  In preen mode, the direction
	   of the conversion is listed and done if possible
	   without user interaction.  Conversion in preen mode is
	   best used when all the file systems are being con-
	   verted at once.  The format of a file system can be
	   determined from the first line of output from
	   _d_u_m_p_f_s(8).

     If no filesystems are given to _f_s_c_k then a default list of
     file systems is read from the file //eettcc//ffssttaabb.

     Inconsistencies checked are as follows:

     1.    Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free map.
     2.    Blocks claimed by an inode outside the range of the
	   file system.
     3.    Incorrect link counts.
     4.    Size checks:
		 Directory size not of proper format.
		 Partially truncated file.
     5.    Bad inode format.
     6.    Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
     7.    Directory checks:
		 File pointing to unallocated inode.
		 Inode number out of range.
     8.    Super Block checks:
		 More blocks for inodes than there are in the
		 file system.
     9.    Bad free block map format.
     10.   Total free block and/or free inode count incorrect.

     Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced)
     are, with the operator's concurrence, reconnected by placing
     them in the lloosstt++ffoouunndd directory.	The name assigned is the
     inode number.  If the _l_o_s_t+_f_o_u_n_d directory does not exist,
     it is created.  If there is insufficient space its size is
     increased.

     Checking the raw device is almost always faster.
