     _R_r_e_s_t_o_r_e obtains from magnetic tape files saved by a previ-
     ous _d_u_m_p(8).  The command is identical in operation to
     _r_e_s_t_o_r_e(8) except the _f key should be specified and the file
     supplied should be of the form _m_a_c_h_i_n_e:_d_e_v_i_c_e.

     machine to access the tape device.
