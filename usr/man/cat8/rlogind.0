     _R_l_o_g_i_n_d is the server for the _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C) program.	The
     server provides a remote login facility with authentication
     based on privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.

     _R_l_o_g_i_n_d listens for service requests at the port indicated
     in the ``login'' service specification; see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5).
     When a service request is received the following protocol is
     initiated:

     1)   The server checks the client's source port.  If the
	  port is not in the range 0-1023, the server aborts the
	  connection.

     2)   The server checks the client's source address and
	  requests the corresponding host name (see
	  _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_a_d_d_r(3N), _h_o_s_t_s(5) and _n_a_m_e_d(8)).  If the
	  hostname cannot be determined, the dot-notation
	  representation of the host address is used.

     Once the source port and address have been checked, _r_l_o_g_i_n_d
     allocates a pseudo terminal (see _p_t_y(4)), and manipulates
     file descriptors so that the slave half of the pseudo termi-
     nal becomes the ssttddiinn ,, ssttddoouutt ,, and ssttddeerrrr for a login pro-
     cess.  The login process is an instance of the _l_o_g_i_n(1) pro-
     gram, invoked with the --rr option.	The login process then
     proceeds with the authentication process as described in
     _r_s_h_d(8C), but if automatic authentication fails, it
     reprompts the user to login as one finds on a standard ter-
     minal line.

     The parent of the login process manipulates the master side
     of the pseduo terminal, operating as an intermediary between
     the login process and the client instance of the _r_l_o_g_i_n pro-
     gram.  In normal operation, the packet protocol described in
     _p_t_y(4) is invoked to provide ^S/^Q type facilities and pro-
     pagate interrupt signals to the remote programs.  The login
     process propagates the client terminal's baud rate and ter-
     minal type, as found in the environment variable, ``TERM'';
     see _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7).  The screen or window size of the terminal
     is requested from the client, and window size changes from
     the client are propagated to the pseudo terminal.

BBUUGGSS
     The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
     of each client machine and the connecting medium.	This is
     insecure, but is useful in an ``open'' environment.

     A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted
     should be present.

     A more extensible protocol should be used.
