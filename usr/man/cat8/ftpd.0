     _F_t_p_d is the DARPA Internet File Transfer Prototocol server
     process.  The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at
     the port specified in the ``ftp'' service specification; see
     _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5).

     If the --dd option is specified, debugging information is
     written to the syslog.

     If the --ll option is specified, each ftp session is logged in
     the syslog.

     The ftp server will timeout an inactive session after 15
     minutes.  If the --tt option is specified, the inactivity
     timeout period will be set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t.

     The ftp server currently supports the following ftp
     requests;	case is not distinguished.

     The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet RFC 959 are
     recognized, but not implemented.

     The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when
     the ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process"
     (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Tel-
     net stream, as described in Internet RFC 959.

     _F_t_p_d interprets file names according to the ``globbing''
     conventions used by _c_s_h(1).  This allows users to utilize
     the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.

     _F_t_p_d authenticates users according to three rules.

     1)   The user name must be in the password data base,
	  /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d, and not have a null password.  In this
	  case a password must be provided by the client before
	  any file operations may be performed.

     2)   The user name must not appear in the file
	  /_e_t_c/_f_t_p_u_s_e_r_s.

     3)   The user must have a standard shell returned by
	  _g_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l(3).

     4)   If the user name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an
	  anonymous ftp account must be present in the password
	  file (user ``ftp'').	In this case the user is allowed
	  to log in by specifying any password (by convention
	  this is given as the client host's name).

     In the last case, _f_t_p_d takes special measures to restrict
     the client's access privileges.  The server performs a
     _c_h_r_o_o_t(2) command to the home directory of the ``ftp'' user.
     In order that system security is not breached, it is recom-
     mended that the ``ftp'' subtree be constructed with care;
     the following rules are recommended.

     ~ftp)
	  Make the home directory owned by ``ftp'' and unwritable
	  by anyone.

     ~ftp/bin)
	  Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwrit-
	  able by anyone.  The program _l_s(1) must be present to

	  support the list commands.  This program should have
	  mode 111.

     ~ftp/etc)
	  Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwrit-
	  able by anyone.  The files _p_a_s_s_w_d(5) and _g_r_o_u_p(5) must
	  be present for the _l_s command to work properly.  These
	  files should be mode 444.

     ~ftp/pub)
	  Make this directory mode 777 and owned by ``ftp''.
	  Users should then place files which are to be accessi-
	  ble via the anonymous account in this directory.

     The anonymous account is inherently dangerous and should
     avoided when possible.

     The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with
     privileged port numbers.  It maintains an effective user id
     of the logged in user, reverting to the super-user only when
     binding addresses to sockets.  The possible security holes
     have been extensively scrutinized, but are possibly incom-
     plete.
