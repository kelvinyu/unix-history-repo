     The _a_r_p program displays and modifies the Internet-to-
     Ethernet address translation tables used by the address
     resolution protocol (_a_r_p(4p)).

     With no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry
     for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e. The host may be specified by name or by
     number, using Internet dot notation.  With the --aa flag, the
     program displays all of the current ARP entries by reading
     the table from the file _k_m_e_m (default /dev/kmem) based on
     the kernel file _v_m_u_n_i_x (default /vmunix).

     With the --dd flag, a super-user may delete an entry for the
     host called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.

     The --ss flag is given to create an ARP entry for the host
     called _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e with the Ethernet address _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r. The
     Ethernet address is given as six hex bytes separated by
     colons.  The entry will be permanent unless the word tteemmpp is
     given in the command. If the word ppuubb is given, the entry
     will be "published"; i.e., this system will act as an ARP
     server, responding to requests for _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e even though the
     host address is not its own.  The word ttrraaiill indicates that
     trailer encapsulations may be sent to this host.

     The --ff flag causes the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to be read and multiple
     entries to be set in the ARP tables.  Entries in the file
     should be of the form

	  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _e_t_h_e_r__a_d_d_r [ tteemmpp ] [ ppuubb ] [ ttrraaiill ]

     with argument meanings as given above.
