     _K_g_m_o_n is a tool used when profiling the operating system.
     When no arguments are supplied, _k_g_m_o_n indicates the state of
     operating system profiling as running, off, or not config-
     ured.  (see _c_o_n_f_i_g(8)) If the --pp flag is specified, _k_g_m_o_n
     extracts profile data from the operating system and produces
     a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file suitable for later analysis by _g_p_r_o_f(1).

     The following options may be specified:

     --bb   Resume the collection of profile data.

     --hh   Stop the collection of profile data.

     --pp   Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a
	  _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file.

     --rr   Reset all the profile buffers. If the --pp flag is also
	  specified, the _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file is generated before the
	  buffers are reset.

     If neither --bb nor --hh is specified, the state of profiling
     collection remains unchanged.  For example, if the --pp flag
     is specified and profile data is being collected, profiling
     will be momentarily suspended, the operating system profile
     buffers will be dumped, and profiling will be immediately
     resumed.

     Users with only read permission on /dev/kmem cannot change
     the state of profiling collection. They can get a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t
     file with the warning that the data may be inconsistent if
     profiling is in progress.
