     _S_a_v_e_c_o_r_e is meant to be called near the end of the /etc/rc
     file.  Its function is to save the core dump of the system
     (assuming one was made) and to write a reboot message in the
     shutdown log.

     Savecore checks the core dump to be certain it corresponds
     with the current running unix.  If it does it saves the core
     image in the file _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/vmcore.n and its brother, the
     namelist, _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/vmunix.n The trailing ".n" in the path-
     names is replaced by a number which grows every time
     _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e is run in that directory.

     Before savecore writes out a core image, it reads a number
     from the file _d_i_r_n_a_m_e/minfree.  If the number of free kilo-
     bytes on the filesystem which contains _d_i_r_n_a_m_e is less than
     the number obtained from the minfree file, the core dump is
     not saved.  If the minfree file does not exist, savecore
     always writes out the core file (assuming that a core dump
     was taken).

     _S_a_v_e_c_o_r_e also logs a reboot message using facility LOG_AUTH
     (see _s_y_s_l_o_g(3)) If the system crashed as a result of a
     panic, _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e logs the panic string too.

     If the core dump was from a system other than /vmunix, the
     name of that system must be supplied as _s_y_s_n_a_m_e.

     Can be fooled into thinking a core dump is the wrong size.
