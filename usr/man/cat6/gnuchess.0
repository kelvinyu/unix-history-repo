     _C_h_e_s_s plays a game of chess against the user. Or it plays
     against itself. Or it referees a game.

     _C_h_e_s_s has two display modes. The first mode is simply a nor-
     mal mode that you could use with a terminal. The second mode
     is a fancy display mode you can use with a SUN workstation.
     To use the former, simply type 'gnuchess'. To use the
     latter, simply type 'chesstool gnuchess' on a SUN worksta-
     tion where 'chesstool' is installed. In the latter example,
     the argument should be the path specifying where to find the
     gnuchess binary.

     The following documentation assumes you are in the first
     mode (e.g. normal mode using a regular terminal). If not,
     then you should read the chesstool documentation.

     For help once in _C_h_e_s_s type a question-mark. To type in your
     move, use the notation "e2e4" where the first letter-number
     pair indicates the origination square and the second
     letter-number pair indicates the destination square.  The
     letter indicates the column with the left-most column being
     "a" and the right-most column being "h".  The number indi-
     cates the row, the first row (White's first rank) being "1"
     and the last row (Black's first rank) being "8". To castle,
     type the origin square of the king and the destination
     square of the king, just as you would do for a regular move.

     The "bd" command prints what the current board position
     looks like. You may type this to see what the board looks
     like after the computer moves.

     The "book" command compiles the opening book into dbm(3)
     format. This book is then consulted whenever the computer
     makes a move. If the current position is in the book, then
     the suggested move associated with that position will be
     made as the computer's move. Note that this command is a
     maintenance command, usually used only once per site per
     book.

     The "depth" command allows the user to change how many moves
     ahead the computer looks. Normally, it looks ahead three
     half-moves, examining every move for each side.  Then, it
     examines all captures for both sides for another two half-
     moves. "Depth" changes the first of these values.	There is
     an upper boundary of five half-moves as set by the

     quiescence search which searches captures a little deeper to
     get better tactical play.

     The "enter" command causes the current game played thus far
     to be entered in the human-readable version of the opening
     book. If no current game is in progress, this command
     requests the name of a file from which to read games. These
     are then added to the binary database.  Since the versions
     of the two files are slightly different, in the former case,
     you must additionally type "book" to get the new game fully
     entered in the book.  Also, the "enter" command tries to
     mail your new additions to the book maintainers so that your
     contributions can be added to the master copy of the book.
     If you are not on our network, you should send us your new
     additions via some other method.

     "Fill" allows the user to specify a completely different
     board position. Input is based on Forsythe notation.  For
     example, the opening position in Forsythe notation is
     "rnbqkbnrpppppppp8888PPPPPPPPRNBQKBNR+". Capital letters
     indicate a White piece, lower-case Black. A plus means it is
     White's move, a minus means Black's.

     "History" and "historyf" list the game as played so far to
     the terminal and a file respectively. The file is assumed to
     be "GAMES/chXXXXXX" where XXXXXX is a random number and
     GAMES is a subdirectory. If GAMES does not exist, an error
     message is reported. The equivalent of "historyf" is done
     after every move automatically to record the game thus far.

     "Legals" shows legal moves for the current position along
     with the rating for each move based on a positional presort.

     "Neither" instructs the program to play neither side, that
     is, to simply act as a referee.

     "Reset" resets the board to the starting position.

     "Quit" exits the game.

     "Read" restores a game as if you were still playing it.  The
     game must be in the format as written by "historyf" or as
     automatically recorded by the program itself after every
     move.

     "Self" causes the program to play against itself.

     "Static" causes a static evaluation to be done for the
     current position. A static evaluation is based on material
     difference only. Positional considerations are handled by
     the ply-1 positional presort.

     "Switch" causes the program to move, whether or not it is
     the program's turn to do so. Continually typing "switch" is
     equivalent to typing "self".

     "Test-moves" initiates a test of the speed of the move gen-
     erator. An initial series of move generations is done for
     the opening position and the timing speed is reported.
     Then, for each of ten stored test positions, a series of
     move generations is done and the timing speed is reported
     for each one. Finally, the program averages across those ten
     runs and reports the overall average.

     "Test-search" uses the ten stored test positions to actually
     conduct a search at the current depth to choose a move for
     each position.

     "Undo" undoes the last move whether it was the computer's or
     the human's. You may also type "remove". This is equivalent
     to two "undo's" (e.g. retract one move for each side).

     The flag-option on the command line allows specification of
     how deep to search in half-moves as with 'Chess -3' to
     search three half-moves ahead. Capture searches are normally
     carried out a few half-moves further than the regular full
     search specified with this option. This is known as the
     quiescence search and it usually is conducted to 6 ply. This
     option is identical to the "depth" command once in the pro-
     gram.

BBUUGGSS
     En passant is not currently implemented. Also, promotion to
     pieces other than queens is disallowed. Checks and check-
     mates are not detected in the tree-search and are not han-
     dled as "forcing" variations.

     There are other bugs. Suggestions for improvements and
     caveats are contained in the files README and TODO which
     come with this distribution.
