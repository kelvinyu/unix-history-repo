     _F_o_r_t_u_n_e with no arguments prints out a random adage. The
     flags mean:

     --ww   Waits before termination for an amount of time calcu-
	  lated from the number of characters in the message.
	  This is useful if it is executed as part of the logout
	  procedure to guarantee that the message can be read
	  before the screen is cleared.

     --ss   Short messages only.

     --ll   Long messages only.

     --oo   Choose from an alternate list of adages, often used for
	  potentially offensive ones.

     --aa   Choose from either list of adages.
