     _C_h_e_s_s is a computer program that plays class D chess.  Moves
     may be given either in standard (descriptive) notation or in
     algebraic notation.  The symbol `+' is used to specify
     check; `o-o' and `o-o-o' specify castling.  To play black,
     type `first'; to print the board, type an empty line.

     Each move is echoed in the appropriate notation followed by
     the program's reply.

     The most cryptic diagnostic is `eh?' which means that the
     input was syntactically incorrect.

     Pawns may be promoted only to queens.  The book of opening
     moves has disappeared.
