     Brian Horn (cithep!bdh) showed me a _T_O_P_S-_2_0 program  on  the
     DEC-2136  machine	called _W_O_R_M, and suggested that I write a
     similar program that would run under _U_n_i_x.  I  did,  and  no
     apologies.

     --ff makes a "field" for the worm(s) to eat;  --tt  causes  each
     worm  to  leave  a  trail behind it.  You can figure out the
     rest by yourself.

     The lower-right-hand character position will not be  updated
     properly on a terminal that wraps at the right margin.

     Terminal initialization is not performed.
