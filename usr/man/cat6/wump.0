     _W_u_m_p plays the game of `Hunt the Wumpus.' A Wumpus is a
     creature that lives in a cave with several rooms connected
     by tunnels.  You wander among the rooms, trying to shoot the
     Wumpus with an arrow, meanwhile avoiding being eaten by the
     Wumpus and falling into Bottomless Pits.  There are also
     Super Bats which are likely to pick you up and drop you in
     some random room.

     The program asks various questions which you answer one per
     line; it will give a more detailed description if you want.

     This program is based on one described in _P_e_o_p_l_e'_s _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r
     _C_o_m_p_a_n_y, _2, 2 (November 1973).
