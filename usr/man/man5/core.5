.TH CORE 5 
.SH NAME
core \- format of memory image file
.SH DESCRIPTION
UNIX
writes out a memory image of a terminated
process when any of various errors occur.
See
.IR signal (2)
for the list of reasons;
the most common are memory violations, illegal
instructions, bus errors, and user-generated
quit signals.
The memory image is called `core' and is written in the process's
working directory (provided it can be; normal
access controls apply).
.PP
In general the debugger
.IR adb (1)
is sufficient to deal with core images.
