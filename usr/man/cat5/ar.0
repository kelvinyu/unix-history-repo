     The archive command _a_r combines several files into one.
     Archives are used mainly as libraries to be searched by the
     link-editor _l_d.

     A file produced by _a_r has a magic string at the start, fol-
     lowed by the constituent files, each preceded by a file
     header.  The magic number and header layout as described in
     the include file are:

	   */

	  #define ARMAG  "!<arch>\n"
	  #define SARMAG 8

	  #define ARFMAG "`\n"

	  struct ar_hdr {
		  char	 ar_name[16];
		  char	 ar_date[12];
		  char	 ar_uid[6];
		  char	 ar_gid[6];
		  char	 ar_mode[8];
		  char	 ar_size[10];
		  char	 ar_fmag[2];
	  };

     The name is a blank-padded string.  The _a_r__f_m_a_g field con-
     tains ARFMAG to help verify the presence of a header.  The
     other fields are left-adjusted, blank-padded numbers.  They
     are decimal except for _a_r__m_o_d_e, which is octal.  The date is
     the modification date of the file at the time of its inser-
     tion into the archive.

     Each file begins on a even (0 mod 2) boundary; a new-line is
     inserted between files if necessary.  Nevertheless the size
     given reflects the actual size of the file exclusive of pad-
     ding.

     There is no provision for empty areas in an archive file.

     The encoding of the header is portable across machines.  If
     an archive contains printable files, the archive itself is
     printable.

     File names lose trailing blanks.  Most software dealing with
     archives takes even an included blank as a name terminator.
