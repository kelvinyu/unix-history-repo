     _M_t_a_b resides in directory /_e_t_c and contains a table of dev-
     ices mounted by the _m_o_u_n_t command.  _U_m_o_u_n_t removes entries.

     The table is a series of _m_t_a_b structures, as defined in
     <mtab.h>.	Each entry contains the null-padded name of the
     place where the special file is mounted, the null-padded
     name of the special file, and a type field, one of those
     defined in <_f_s_t_a_b._h>.  The special file has all its direc-
     tories stripped away; that is, everything through the last
     `/' is thrown away.  The type field indicates if the file
     system is mounted read-only, read-write, or read-write with
     disk quotas enabled.

     This table is present only so people can look at it.  It
     does not matter to _m_o_u_n_t if there are duplicated entries nor
     to _u_m_o_u_n_t if a name cannot be found.
