.SH NAME
hp \- MASSBUS disk interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "disk hp0 at mba0 drive 0"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``hp'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
The block file's access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
This driver handles both standard DEC controllers and Emulex
SC750 and SC780 controllers.  Standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register.  For
the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
to indicate the drive is an RM02.  When this is encountered,
the driver checks the holding register to find out
the disk geometry and, based on this information, decides what
the drive type is.  The following disks are supported: RM03,
RM05, RP06, RM80, RP05, RP07, ML11A, ML11B, CDC 9775, CDC 9730,
AMPEX Capricorn (32 sectors/track), FUJITSU Eagle (48 sectors/track),
and AMPEX 9300.  The origin and size (in sectors) of the pseudo-disks
on each drive are as follows:

It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one installation,
since there is overlap in addresses and protection becomes
a sticky matter.
The hp?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the hp?b partition as a paging area,
and the hp?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
On disks larger than about 205 Megabytes, the hp?h partition
is inserted prior to the hp?d or hp?g partition;
the hp?g partition then maps the remainder of the pack.
All disk partition tables are calculated using the
.IR diskpart (8)
program.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBhp%d%c: hard error sn%d mbsr=%b er1=%b er2=%b\fR.  An unrecoverable
error occured during transfer of the specified sector of the specified
disk partition.  The MASSBUS status register is printed in hexadecimal and
with the error bits decoded if any error bits other than MBEXC and DTABT
are set.  In any case the contents of the two error registers are also printed
in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
(Note that er2 is what old rp06 manuals would call er3; the terminology
is that of the rm disks).
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.
.PP
\fBhp%d: write locked\fR.  The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBhp%d: not ready\fR.  The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.  The i/o operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBhp%d%c: soft ecc sn%d\fR.  A recoverable ECC error occurred on the
specified sector of the specified disk partition.  This happens normally
a few times a week.  If it happens more frequently than
this the sectors where the errors are occuring should be checked to see
if certain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive
or heads are indicated.
.PP
During autoconfiguration one of the following messages may appear
on the console indicating the appropriate drive type was recognized.
The last message indicates the drive is of a unknown type.

.SH BUGS
In raw I/O
.I read
and
.IR write (2)
truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and
.I write
scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.I read, write
and
.IR lseek (2)
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
.PP
DEC-standard error logging should be supported.
.PP
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
.PP
The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
and this would make packs more portable.
