tape tu0 at ht0 slave 0
.SH DESCRIPTION
The tm-03/transport combination provides a standard tape drive
interface as described in
.IR mt (4).
All drives provide both 800 and 1600 bpi; the TE-16 runs at 45 ips,
the TU-45 at 75 ips, while the TU-77 runs at 125 ips and autoloads tapes.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBtu%d: no write ring\fR.  An attempt was made to write on the tape drive
when no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of
the user who tried to access the tape.
.PP
\fBtu%d: not online\fR.  An attempt was made to access the tape while it
was offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user
who tried to access the tape.
.PP
\fBtu%d: can't switch density in mid-tape\fR.  An attempt was made to write
on a tape at a different density than is already recorded on the tape.
This message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to switch
the density.
.PP
\fBtu%d: hard error bn%d mbsr=%b er=%b ds=%b\fR.   A tape error occurred
at block \fIbn\fR; the ht error register and drive status register are
printed in octal with the bits symbolically decoded.  Any error is
fatal on non-raw tape; when possible the driver will have retried
the operation which failed several times before reporting the error.
.SH BUGS
If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it refuses to do anything
more until closed.
.PP
The system should remember which controlling terminal has the tape drive
open and write error messages to that terminal rather than on the console.
