     These functions extract and use capabilities from a terminal
     capability data base, usually /etc/termcap, the format of
     which is described in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5).	These are low level rou-
     tines; see _c_u_r_s_e_s(3X) for a higher level package.

     _T_g_e_t_e_n_t extracts the entry for terminal _n_a_m_e into the buffer
     at _b_p. _B_p should be a character buffer of size 1024 and must
     be retained through all subsequent calls to _t_g_e_t_n_u_m, _t_g_e_t_-
     _f_l_a_g, and _t_g_e_t_s_t_r. _T_g_e_t_e_n_t returns -1 if none of the termcap
     data base files could be opened, 0 if the terminal name
     given does not have an entry, and 1 if all goes well.  It
     will look in the environment for a TERMCAP variable.  If
     found, and the value does not begin with a slash, and the
     terminal type _n_a_m_e is the same as the environment string
     TERM, the TERMCAP string is used instead of reading a
     termcap file.  If it does begin with a slash, the string is
     used as a path name of the termcap file to search.  If
     TERMCAP does not begin with a slash and _n_a_m_e is different
     from TERM, _t_g_e_t_e_n_t searches the files $HOME/.termcap and

     /etc/termcap, in that order, unless the environment variable
     TERMPATH exists, in which case it specifies a list of file
     pathnames (separated by spaces or colons) to be searched
     instead.  Whenever multiple files are searched and a ttcc
     field occurs in the requested entry, the entry it names must
     be found in the same file or one of the succeeding files.
     This can speed up entry into programs that call _t_g_e_t_e_n_t, as
     well as help debug new terminal descriptions or make one for
     your terminal if you can't write the file /etc/termcap.

     _T_g_e_t_n_u_m gets the numeric value of capability _i_d, returning
     -1 if is not given for the terminal.  _T_g_e_t_f_l_a_g returns 1 if
     the specified capability is present in the terminal's entry,
     0 if it is not.  _T_g_e_t_s_t_r returns the string value of the
     capability _i_d, places it in the buffer at _a_r_e_a, and advances
     the _a_r_e_a pointer.	It decodes the abbreviations for this
     field described in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5), except for cursor addressing
     and padding information.  _T_g_e_t_s_t_r returns NULL if the capa-
     bility was not found.

     _T_g_o_t_o returns a cursor addressing string decoded from _c_m to
     go to column _d_e_s_t_c_o_l in line _d_e_s_t_l_i_n_e. It uses the external
     variables UUPP (from the uupp capability) and BBCC (if bbcc is given
     rather than bbss) if necessary to avoid placing \\nn, ^^DD or ^^@@
     in the returned string.  (Programs which call tgoto should
     be sure to turn off the XTABS bit(s), since _t_g_o_t_o may now
     output a tab.  Note that programs using termcap should in
     general turn off XTABS anyway since some terminals use
     control-I for other functions, such as nondestructive
     space.) If a %% sequence is given which is not understood,
     then _t_g_o_t_o returns "OOPS".

     _T_p_u_t_s decodes the leading padding information of the string
     _c_p; _a_f_f_c_n_t gives the number of lines affected by the opera-
     tion, or 1 if this is not applicable, _o_u_t_c is a routine
     which is called with each character in turn.  The external
     variable _o_s_p_e_e_d should contain the output speed of the ter-
     minal as encoded by _s_t_t_y(3).  The external variable PPCC
     should contain a pad character to be used (from the ppcc capa-
     bility) if a null (^^@@) is inappropriate.
