     _P_e_r_r_o_r produces a short error message on the standard error
     file describing the last error encountered during a call to
     the system from a C program.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is non-NULL, it is
     printed, followed by a colon, followed by a space, followed
     by the message and a new-line.  Otherwise, just the message
     and the new-line are printed.  Most usefully, the argument
     string is the name of the program which incurred the error.
     The error number is taken from the external variable _e_r_r_n_o
     (see _i_n_t_r_o(2)), which is set when errors occur but not
     cleared when non-erroneous calls are made.

     To simplify variant formatting of messages, the vector of
     message strings _s_y_s__e_r_r_l_i_s_t is provided; _e_r_r_n_o can be used
     as an index in this table to get the message string without
     the newline.  _S_y_s__n_e_r_r is the number of messages provided
     for in the table; it should be checked because new error
     codes may be added to the system before they are added to
     the table.
