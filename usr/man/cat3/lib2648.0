DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _L_i_b_2_6_4_8 is a general purpose library of subroutines useful
     for interactive graphics on the Hewlett-Packard 2648 graph-
     ics terminal.  To use it you must call the routine _t_t_y_i_n_i_t()
     at the beginning of execution, and _d_o_n_e() at the end of exe-
     cution.  All terminal input and output must go through the
     routines _r_a_w_c_h_a_r, _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e, _o_u_t_c_h_a_r, and _o_u_t_s_t_r.

     _L_i_b_2_6_4_8 does the necessary ^E/^F handshaking if
     _g_e_t_e_n_v(``_T_E_R_M'') returns ``hp2648'', as it will if set by
     _t_s_e_t(1).  Any other value, including for example ``2648'',
     will disable handshaking.

     Bit matrix routines are provided to model the graphics
     memory of the 2648.  These routines are generally useful,
     but are specifically useful for the _u_p_d_a_t_e function which
     efficiently changes what is on the screen to what is sup-
     posed to be on the screen.  The primative bit matrix rou-
     tines are _n_e_w_m_a_t, _m_a_t, and _s_e_t_m_a_t.

     The file _t_r_a_c_e, if non-null, is expected to be a file
     descriptor as returned by _f_o_p_e_n.  If so, _l_i_b_2_6_4_8 will trace
     the progress of the output by writing onto this file.  It is
     provided to make debugging output feasible for graphics pro-
     grams without messing up the screen or the escape sequences
     being sent.  Typical use of trace will include:
	  sswwiittcchh (argv[1][1]) {
	  ccaassee 'T':
	       trace = fopen("trace", "w");
	       bbrreeaakk;
	  ...
	  iiff (trace)
	       fprintf(trace, "x is %d, y is %s\n", x, y);
	  ...
	  dumpmat("before update", xmat);

     aaooffff(())
	  Turn the alphanumeric display off.

     aaoonn(())
	  Turn the alphanumeric display on.

     aarreeaacclleeaarr((rrmmiinn,, ccmmiinn,, rrmmaaxx,, ccmmaaxx))
	  Clear the area on the graphics screen bordered by the
	  four arguments.  In normal mode the area is set to all
	  black, in inverse video mode it is set to all white.

     bbeeeepp(())
	  Ring the bell on the terminal.

     bbiittccooppyy((ddeesstt,, ssrrcc,, rroowwss,, ccoollss)) bbiittmmaatt ddeesstt,,

	  vided) _d_e_s_t.

     cclleeaarraa(())
	  Clear the alphanumeric display.

     cclleeaarrgg(())
	  Clear the graphics display.  Note that the 2648 will
	  only clear the part of the screen that is visible if
	  zoomed in.

     ccuurrooffff(())
	  Turn the graphics cursor off.

     ccuurroonn(())
	  Turn the graphics cursor on.

	  Display the message _s_t_r in graphics text at position
	  (_x, _y). The maximum message length is given by _m_a_x_l_e_n,
	  and is needed for dispmsg to know how big an area to
	  clear before drawing the message.  The lower left
	  corner of the first character is at (_x, _y).

     ddoonnee(())
	  Should be called before the program exits.  Restores
	  the tty to normal, turns off graphics screen, turns on
	  alphanumeric screen, flushes the standard output, etc.

     ddrraaww((xx,, yy))
	  Draw a line from the pen location to (_x, _y). As with
	  all graphics coordinates, (_x, _y) is measured from the
	  bottom left corner of the screen.  (_x, _y) coordinates
	  represent the first quadrant of the usual Cartesian
	  system.

LIB2648(3X)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LIB2648(3X)



	  Draw a rectangular box on the graphics screen.  The
	  lower left corner is at location (_r, _c). The box is
	  _r_o_w_s rows high and _c_o_l_s columns wide.  The box is drawn
	  if _c_o_l_o_r is 1, erased if _c_o_l_o_r is 0.	(_r, _c) absolute
	  coordinates represent row and column on the screen,
	  with the origin at the lower left.  They are equivalent
	  to (_x, _y) except for being reversed in order.

	  If _t_r_a_c_e is non-null, write a readable ASCII represen-
	  tation of the matrix _m on _t_r_a_c_e. _M_s_g is a label to
	  identify the output.

     eemmppttyyrrooww((mm,, rroowwss,, ccoollss,, rr)) bbiittmmaatt mm;;
	  Returns 1 if row _r of matrix _m is all zero, else
	  returns 0.  This routine is provided because it can be
	  implemented more efficiently with a knowledge of the
	  internal representation than a series of calls to _m_a_t.

     eerrrroorr((mmssgg)) cchhaarr **mmssgg;;
	  Default error handler.  Calls _m_e_s_s_a_g_e(_m_s_g) and returns.
	  This is called by certain routines in _l_i_b_2_6_4_8.  It is
	  also suitable for calling by the user program.  It is
	  probably a good idea for a fancy graphics program to
	  supply its own error procedure which uses _s_e_t_j_m_p(3) to
	  restart the program.

     ggddeeffaauulltt(())
	  Set the terminal to the default graphics modes.

     ggooffff(())
	  Turn the graphics display off.

     ggoonn(())
	  Turn the graphics display on.

     kkooffff(())
	  Turn the keypad off.

     kkoonn(())
	  Turn the keypad on.  This means that most special keys
	  on the terminal (such as the alphanumeric arrow keys)
	  will transmit an escape sequence instead of doing their
	  function locally.

     lliinnee((xx11,, yy11,, xx22,, yy22))
	  Draw a line in the current mode from (_x_1, _y_1) to (_x_2,
	  _y_2). This is equivalent to _m_o_v_e(_x_1, _y_1); _d_r_a_w(_x_2, _y_2);
	  except that a bug in the terminal involving repeated
	  lines from the same point is compensated for.

	  Used to retrieve an element from a bit matrix.  Returns
	  1 or 0 as the value of the [_r, _c] element of the _r_o_w_s
	  by _c_o_l_s matrix _m. Bit matrices are numbered (_r, _c) from
	  the upper left corner of the matrix, beginning at (0,
	  0).  _R represents the row, and _c represents the column.

     mmeessssaaggee((ssttrr)) cchhaarr **ssttrr;;

	  Find the smallest rectangle that contains all the 1
	  (on) elements in the bit matrix g.  The coordinates are
	  returned in the variables pointed to by rmin, cmin,
	  rmax, cmax.

     mmoovvee((xx,, yy))
	  Move the pen to location (_x, _y). Such motion is inter-
	  nal and will not cause output until a subsequent
	  _s_y_n_c().

     mmoovveeccuurrss((xx,, yy))
	  Move the graphics cursor to location (_x, _y).

     bbiittmmaatt nneewwmmaatt((rroowwss,, ccoollss))
	  Create (with _m_a_l_l_o_c(3)) a new bit matrix of size _r_o_w_s
	  by _c_o_l_s. The value created (e.g. a pointer to the first
	  location) is returned.  A bit matrix can be freed
	  directly with _f_r_e_e.

     oouuttcchhaarr((cc)) cchhaarr cc;;
	  Print the character _c on the standard output.  All out-
	  put to the terminal should go through this routine or
	  _o_u_t_s_t_r.

     oouuttssttrr((ssttrr)) cchhaarr **ssttrr;;

     cchhaarr **rrddcchhaarr((cc)) cchhaarr cc;;
	  Return a readable representation of the character _c. If
	  _c is a printing character it returns itself, if a con-
	  trol character it is shown in the ^X notation, if nega-
	  tive an apostrophe is prepended.  Space returns ^`,
	  rubout returns ^?.

	  NNOOTTEE:: A pointer to a static place is returned.  For

	  the same _f_p_r_i_n_t_f/_s_p_r_i_n_t_f call.  You must instead save
	  one of the values in your own buffer with strcpy.

	  Display _p_r_o_m_p_t on the bottom line of the graphics
	  display and read one line of text from the user, ter-
	  minated by a newline.  The line is placed in the buffer
	  _m_s_g, which has size _m_a_x_l_e_n characters.  Backspace pro-
	  cessing is supported.

     sseettcclleeaarr(())
	  Set the display to draw lines in erase mode.	(This is

	  The basic operation to store a value in an element of a
	  bit matrix.  The [_r, _c] element of _m is set to _v_a_l,
	  which should be either 0 or 1.

     sseettsseett(())
	  Set the display to draw lines in normal (solid) mode.
	  (This is reversed by inverse video mode.)

     sseettxxoorr(())
	  Set the display to draw lines in exclusive or mode.

     ssyynncc(())
	  Force all accumulated output to be displayed on the
	  screen.  This should be followed by fflush(stdout).
	  The cursor is not affected by this function.	Note that
	  it is normally never necessary to call _s_y_n_c, since
	  _r_a_w_c_h_a_r and _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e call _s_y_n_c() and _f_f_l_u_s_h(_s_t_d_o_u_t)
	  automatically.

	  of the window is [_b_a_s_e_r, _b_a_s_e_c]. Note: _u_p_d_a_t_e was not
	  intended to be used for the entire screen.  It would
	  work but be very slow and take 64K bytes of memory just

     This library is not supported.  It makes no attempt to use
     all of the features of the terminal, only those needed by
     fed.  Contributions from users will be accepted for addition
     to the library.

     The HP 2648 terminal is somewhat unreliable at speeds over
     2400 baud, even with the ^E/^F handshaking.  In an effort to
     improve reliability, handshaking is done every 32 charac-
     ters.  (The manual claims it is only necessary every 80
     characters.) Nonetheless, I/O errors sometimes still occur.

     There is no way to control the amount of debugging output
     generated on _t_r_a_c_e without modifying the source to the
     library.
