.SH NAME
mklost+found \- make a lost+found directory for fsck
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/mklost+found
.SH DESCRIPTION
A directory
.I lost+found
is created in the current directory and a number of empty files
are created therein and then removed so that there will be
empty slots for
.IR fsck (8).
This command should not normally be needed since 
.IR mkfs (8)
automatically creates the
.I lost+found
directory when a new file system is created.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
fsck(8),
mkfs(8)
