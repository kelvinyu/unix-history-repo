     _C_a_l prints a calendar for the specified year.  If a month is
     also specified, a calendar just for that month is printed.
     If no arguments are given, a calendar for the current month
     is printed.  _Y_e_a_r can be between 1 and 9999.  The _m_o_n_t_h is a
     number between 1 and 12.  The calendar produced is that for
     England and her colonies.

     Try September 1752.

BBUUGGSS
     The year is always considered to start in January even
     though this is historically naive.
     Beware that `cal 78' refers to the early Christian era, not
     the 20th century.
