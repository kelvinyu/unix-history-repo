     _A_s assembles the named files, or the standard input if no
     file name is specified.  The available flags are:

     --aa   Specifies the alignment of procedures and data blocks.
	  It is given as a power of two; thus an alignment of 3
	  causes alignment on an eight byte boundary.  The
	  default is --aa22..

     --dd   Specifies the number of bytes to be assembled for
	  offsets which involve forward or external references,
	  and which have sizes unspecified in the assembly
	  language.  The default is --dd44..

     --LL   Save defined labels beginning with a `L', which are
	  normally discarded to save space in the resultant sym-
	  bol table.  The compilers generate such temporary
	  labels.

     --VV   Use virtual memory for some intermediate storage,
	  rather than a temporary file.

     --WW   Do not complain about errors.

     --JJ   Use long branches to resolve jumps when byte-
	  displacement branches are insufficient.  This must be
	  used when a compiler-generated assembly contains
	  branches of more than 32k bytes.

     --RR   Make initialized data segments read-only, by con-
	  catenating them to the text segments.  This obviates
	  the need to run editor scripts on assembly code to make
	  initialized data read-only and shared.

     --tt   Specifies a directory to receive the temporary file,
	  other than the default /tmp.

     All undefined symbols in the assembly are treated as global.

     The output of the assembly is left on the file _o_b_j_f_i_l_e; if
     that is omitted, _a._o_u_t is used.

     --JJ should be eliminated; the assembler should automatically
     choose among byte, word and long branches.
