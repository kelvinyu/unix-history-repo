     _M_t is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.  If a
     tape name is not specified, the environment variable TAPE is
     used;  if TAPE does not exist, _m_t uses the device
     /_d_e_v/_r_m_t_1_2.  Note that _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e must reference a raw (not
     block) tape device.  By default _m_t performs the requested
     operation once.  Operations may be performed multiple times
     by specifying _c_o_u_n_t.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many char-
     acters as are required to uniquely identify a command need
     be specified.

     eeooff, wweeooff
	  Write _c_o_u_n_t end-of-file marks at the current position
	  on the tape.

     ffssff  Forward space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     ffssrr  Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     bbssff  Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     bbssrr  Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     rreewwiinndd
	  Rewind the tape (_C_o_u_n_t is ignored).

     oofffflliinnee, rreewwooffffll
	  Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (_C_o_u_n_t
	  is ignored).

     ssttaattuuss
	  Print status information about the tape unit.

     _M_t returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were suc-
     cessful, 1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an
     operation failed.
