     Wait until all processes started with && have completed, and
     report on abnormal terminations.

     Because the _w_a_i_t(2) system call must be executed in the
     parent process, the Shell itself executes _w_a_i_t, without
     creating a new process.

BBUUGGSS
     Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage pipeline are
     children of the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.  (This
     bug does not apply to _c_s_h(1).)
