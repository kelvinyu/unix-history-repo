     _t_e_s_t evaluates the expression _e_x_p_r, and if its value is true
     then returns zero exit status; otherwise, a non zero exit
     status is returned.  _t_e_s_t returns a non zero exit if there
     are no arguments.

     The following primitives are used to construct _e_x_p_r.

     --rr file  true if the file exists and is readable.

     --ww file  true if the file exists and is writable.

     --ff file  true if the file exists and is not a directory.

     --dd file  true if the file exists and is a directory.

     --ss file  true if the file exists and has a size greater than
	      zero.

     --tt [ fildes ]
	      true if the open file whose file descriptor number
	      is _f_i_l_d_e_s (1 by default) is associated with a ter-
	      minal device.

     --zz s1    true if the length of string _s_1 is zero.

     --nn s1    true if the length of the string _s_1 is nonzero.

     s1 == s2  true if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are equal.

     s1 !!== s2 true if the strings _s_1 and _s_2 are not equal.

     s1       true if _s_1 is not the null string.

     n1 --eeqq n2
	      true if the integers _n_1 and _n_2 are algebraically
	      equal.  Any of the comparisons --nnee, --ggtt, --ggee, --lltt,
	      or --llee may be used in place of --eeqq.

     These primaries may be combined with the following opera-
     tors:

     !!	  unary negation operator

     --aa   binary _a_n_d operator

     --oo   binary _o_r operator

     (( expr ))
	  parentheses for grouping.

     --aa has higher precedence than --oo.. Notice that all the opera-
     tors and flags are separate arguments to _t_e_s_t.  Notice also
     that parentheses are meaningful to the Shell and must be
     escaped.
