     ranlib - convert archives to random libraries

     _R_a_n_l_i_b converts each _a_r_c_h_i_v_e to a form which the loader can
     load more rapidly.  _R_a_n_l_i_b does this by adding a table of
     contents called ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF to the beginning of the archive.
     _R_a_n_l_i_b uses _a_r(1) to reconstruct the archive, so that suffi-
     cient temporary file space must be available in the file
     system which contains the current directory.

     If given the --tt option, ranlib only "touches" the archives
     and does not modify them.	This is useful after copying an
     archive or using the --tt option of _m_a_k_e(1) in order to avoid
     having _l_d(1) complain about an "out of date" symbol table.

BBUUGGSS
     Because generation of a library by _a_r and randomization of
     the library by _r_a_n_l_i_b are separate processes, phase errors
     are possible.  The loader, _l_d, warns when the modification
     date of a library is more recent than the creation date of
     its dictionary;  but this means that you get the warning
     even if you only copy the library.
