     whereis - locate source, binary, and or manual for program

     _W_h_e_r_e_i_s locates source/binary and manuals sections for
     specified files.  The supplied names are first stripped of
     leading pathname components and any (single) trailing exten-
     sion of the form ``.ext'', e.g. ``.c''.  Prefixes of ``s.''
     resulting from use of source code control are also dealt
     with.  _W_h_e_r_e_i_s then attempts to locate the desired program
     in a list of standard places.  If any of the --bb,, --ss or --mm
     flags are given then _w_h_e_r_e_i_s searches only for binaries,
     sources or manual sections respectively (or any two
     thereof).	The --uu flag may be used to search for unusual
     entries.  A file is said to be unusual if it does not have
     one entry of each requested type.	Thus ``whereis -m -u *''
     asks for those files in the current directory which have no
     documentation.

     Finally, the --BB --MM and --SS flags may be used to change or
     otherwise limit the places where _w_h_e_r_e_i_s searches.  The --ff
     file flags is used to terminate the last such directory list
     and signal the start of file names.

     The following finds all the files in /usr/bin which are not
     documented in /usr/man/man1 with source in /usr/src/cmd:

	  cd /usr/ucb
	  whereis -u -M /usr/man/man1 -S /usr/src/cmd -f *

FFIILLEESS
     /usr/src/*
     /usr/{doc,man}/*
     /lib, /etc, /usr/{lib,bin,ucb,old,new,local}

BBUUGGSS
     Since the program uses _c_h_d_i_r(2) to run faster, pathnames
     given with the --MM --SS and --BB must be full; i.e. they must
     begin with a ``/''.
