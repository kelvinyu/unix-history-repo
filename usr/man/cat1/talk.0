     _T_a_l_k is a visual communication program which copies lines
     from your terminal to that of another user.

     If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then
     _p_e_r_s_o_n is just the person's login name.  If you wish to talk
     to a user on another host, then _p_e_r_s_o_n is of the form
     _u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t.

     If you want to talk to a user who is logged in more than
     once, the _t_t_y_n_a_m_e argument may be used to indicate the
     appropriate terminal name, where _t_t_y_n_a_m_e is of the form
     ``ttyXX''.

     When first called, _t_a_l_k sends the message

	  Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine...
	  talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine.
	  talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine

     to the user you wish to talk to. At this point, the reci-
     pient of the message should reply by typing

	  talk	your_name@your_machine

     It doesn't matter from which machine the recipient replies,
     as long as his login-name is the same.  Once communication
     is established, the two parties may type simultaneously,
     with their output appearing in separate windows.  Typing
     control L (^L) will cause the screen to be reprinted, while
     your erase, kill, and word kill characters will behave nor-
     mally.  To exit, just type your interrupt character; _t_a_l_k
     then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and
     restores the terminal to its previous state.

     Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the
     _m_e_s_g command.  At the outset talking is allowed.  Certain
     commands, in particular _n_r_o_f_f and _p_r, disallow messages in
     order to prevent messy output.

     /etc/utmp	    to find the recipient's tty

BBUUGGSS
     The version of _t_a_l_k(1) released with 4.3BSD uses a protocol
     that is incompatible with the protocol used in the version
     released with 4.2BSD.
