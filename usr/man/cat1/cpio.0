     Cpio -o (copy out) reads the standard input to obtain a list
     of path names and copies those files onto the standard out-
     put together with path name and status information.  Output
     is padded to a 512-byte boundary.

     Cpio -i (copy in) extracts files from the standard input,
     which is assumed to be the product of a previous cpio -o.
     Only files with names that match patterns are selected.
     Patterns are given in the name-generating notation of sh(1).
     In patterns, meta-characters ?, *, and [...] match the slash
     / character.  Multiple patterns may be specified and if no
     patterns are specified, the default for patterns is * (i.e.,
     select all files).  The extracted files are conditionally
     created and copied into the current directory tree based
     upon the options described below.	The permissions of the
     files will be those of the previous cpio -o.  The owner and
     group of the files will be that of the current user unless
     the user is super-user, which causes cpio to retain the
     owner and group of the files of the previous cpio -o.

     Cpio -p (pass) reads the standard input to obtain a list of
     path names of files that are conditionally created and
     copied into the destination directory tree based upon the
     options described below.

     The meanings of the available options are:

     a	  Reset access times of input files after they have been
	  copied.

     B	  Input/output is to be blocked 5,120 bytes to the record
	  (does not apply to the pass options; meaningful only
	  with data directed to or from /dev/rmt/??).

     d	  Directories are to be created as needed.

     c	  Write header information in ASCII character form for
	  portability.

     r	  Interactively rename files.  If the user types a null
	  line, the files is skipped.

     t	  Print a table of contents of the input.  No files are

	  created.

     u	  Copy unconditionally (normally, an older file will not
	  replace a newer file with the same name).

     v	  Verbose: causes a list of file names to be printed.
	  When used with the t option, the table of contents
	  looks like the output of an ls -l command (see ls(1)).

     l	  Whenever possible, link files rather than copying them.
	  Usable only with the -p option.

     m	  Retain previous file modification time.  This option is
	  ineffective on directories that are being copied.

     f	  Copy in all files except those in patterns.

     s	  Swap bytes.  Use only with the -i option.

     S	  Swap halfwords.  Use only with the -i option.

     b	  Swap both bytes and halfwords.  Use only with the -i
	  option.

     6	  Process an old (i.e., UNIX System Sixth Edition format)
	  file.  Only useful with -i (copy in).

     The first example below copies the contents of a directory
     into an archive; the second duplicates a directory hierar-
     chy:

	  ls | cpio -o >/dev/rmt/0m

	  cd olddir
	  find . -depth -print | cpio -pdl newdir

     The trivial case
	  ``find . -depth -print | cpio -oB >/dev/fmt/0m''
     can be handled more efficiently by:
	  find . -cpio /dev/rmt/0m

     Path names are restricted to 128 characters.  If there are
     too many unique linked files, the program runs out of memory
     to keep track of them and, thereafter, linking information
     is lost.  Only the super-user can copy special files.  The
