     _P_m_e_r_g_e assembles the named Pascal files into a single stan-
     dard Pascal program.  The resulting program is listed on the
     standard output.  It is intended to be used to merge a col-
     lection of separately compiled modules so that they can be
     run through ppii , or exported to other sites.

     Very minimal error checking is done, so incorrect programs
     will produce unpredictable results.  Block comments should
     be placed after the keyword to which they refer or they are
     likely to end up in bizarre places.
