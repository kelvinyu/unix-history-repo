.SH NAME
swapon, swapoff \- add/delete a swap device for interleaved paging/swapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
index = swapon(blkdev, size, q)
int index;
char *blkdev;
int size, q;
.PP
.ft B
swapoff(index, messily)
int index, messily;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft B
This 4.2 call is not implemented in 4.1c.
.ft R
.PP
.I Swapon
makes the argument block device available to the system for
allocation for paging and swapping.  The number of blocks to be
made available is specified as
.I size
and the \*(lqquality factor\*(rq
is specified as
.IR q.
The latter quantity helps the system decide how to divide the
paging and swapping load.  Higher
.IR q 's
suggest secondary choices for swap areas.  The returned 
.I index
may be used in a later
.I swapoff
call.
.PP
.I Swapoff
removes the usage of the swap device number
.I index
as a system swapping device.  If
.I messily
is not set, then the system attempts to pull pages
off this device by migrating them to other devices.
If
.I messily 
is set (e.g. if the device has crashed), then processes
using the device may have bad things happen to them.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
A 0 return indicates success; \-1 indicates a problem.
.SH ERRORS
To be described.
