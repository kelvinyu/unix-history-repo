.TH ADVENTURE 6
.SH NAME
adventure \- an exploration game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/adventure
.SH DESCRIPTION
The object of the game is to
locate and explore Colossal Cave, find the treasures hidden there,
and bring them back to the building with you.
The program is
self-describing to a point, but part of the game is to discover
its rules.
.PP
To terminate a game, type
`quit';
to save a game for later resumption, type
`suspend'.
Interrupt,
quit,
EOT, or hanging up the phone will all perform a
suspend
operation.
.PP
.I Adventure
keeps a log in /usr/games/advlog of each game played.
Each
time a game terminates, a line is appended to that file containing
the user, date, score, and number of turns.
This log is intended
to let you compare scores with fellow adventurers.
Whether or not a game is logged is controlled by a toggle that is examined
at the end of the game.
Its initial state is \*(lqon\*(rq, to indicate that logging
is to take place.
The command \*(lqlog\*(rq inverts the toggle and reports its new
state.
.PP
The \*(lqsuspend\*(rq command results in writing a file named
.I adv.susp
in your home directory. This file contains the information needed
to restart the game; its presence is checked during initialization to see
if a game is being resumed.

.SH BUGS
