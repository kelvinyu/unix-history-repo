.SH NAME
adventure \- an exploration game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B adventure
.SH DESCRIPTION
The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal Cave, find the
treasures hidden there, and bring them back to the building with you.
The program is self-descriptive to a point, but part of the game is to
discover its rules.
.PP
To terminate a game, enter ``quit''; to save a game for later resumption,
enter ``suspend''.
.SH BUGS
Saving a game creates a large executable file instead of just
the information needed to resume the game.
