dm \- dungeon master
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ln -s dm game
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDm\fP is a program used to regulate game playing.  \fIDm\fP expects to
be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to play.  This is
done by creating symbolic links to \fIdm\fP, in \fI/usr/games\fP, for all
of the regulated games.  The actual binaries for these games should be
placed in a ``hidden'' directory, \fI/usr/games/hide\fP, that may only be
accessed by the \fIdm\fP program.  \fIDm\fP determines if the requested
game is available and, if so, runs it.  The file \fI/usr/games/dm.config\fP
controls the times when games may be run.
.PP
The file \fI/usr/games/nogames\fP may be used to ``turn off'' game
playing.  If the file exists, no game playing is allowed; the contents
of the file will be displayed to any user requesting a game.

.SH BUGS
Since \fIdm\fP must run the games setuid ``games'', it is very important
that all games allowing users to run UNIX commands carefully set both
the real and effective user id's immediately before executing those commands.
It is possibly more important that \fIdm\fP never be setuid anything
except ``games'' so that compromising a game will result only in the user's
ability to play games at will.
