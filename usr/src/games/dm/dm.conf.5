.SH NAME
dm.config \- dm configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDm.config\fP is the configuration file for the \fIdm\fP(8) program.  It
consists of three parts, each separated by percent signs (``%'')
occurring as the first two characters in a line.  Blank lines and lines
preceded by a hash mark (``#'') are ignored.
.PP
The first part of the file sets the standard games hours on a day-by-day
basis.  Entries consist of three white-space separated fields: the
unabbreviated day of the week and the beginning and ending time of the
period of the day when games may not be played.  The time fields are in a
0 based, 24-hour clock.  Any of the time fields may be a non-numeric
character, resulting in no time limitations for that day.
.PP
The second part sets the tty limitations.  Entries consist of two white-space
separated fields: the string "badtty", and the ttyname as returned by
\fIttyname\fP(3).  Games may not be played on tty's listed in this section.
.PP
The third, and final, part sets specific game limitations.  Entries consist
of four white-space separated fields: the name of a game, the highest system
load average at which the game may be played, the maximum users allowed
if the game is to be played, and the priority at which the game is to be run.
Any of these fields may be a non-numeric character, resulting in no game
limitation or priority based on the field.  The game "default" controls the
settings for any game not otherwise listed.  Priorities may not be negative.
