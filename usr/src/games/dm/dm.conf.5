.SH NAME
dm.conf \- dm configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dm.conf
is the configuration file for the
.IR dm (8)
program.
It consists of lines beginning with one of three keywords, ``badtty'',
``game'', and ``time''.  All other lines are ignored.
.PP
Any tty listed after the keyword ``badtty'' may not have games played on
it.  Entries consist of two white-space separated fields: the string
``badtty'' and the ttyname as returned by \fIttyname\fP(3).  For example,
to keep the uucp dialout, ``tty19'', from being used for games, the
entry would be:
.PP
.RS
badtty	/dev/tty19
.RE
.PP
Any day/hour combination listed after the keyword ``time'' will disallow
games during those hours.  Entries consist of four white-space separated
fields: the string ``time'', the unabbreviated day of the week and the
beginning and ending time of a period of the day when games may not be
played.  The time fields are in a 0 based, 24-hour clock.  For example,
the following entry allows games playing before 8AM and after 5PM on
Mondays.
.PP
.RS
time		Monday	8	17
.RE
.PP
Any game listed after the keyword ``game'' will set parameters for a specific
game.  Entries consist of five white-space separated fields: the keyword
``game'', the name of a game, the highest system load average at which the
game may be played, the maximum users allowed if the game is to be played,
and the priority at which the game is to be run.  Any of these fields may
start with a non-numeric character, resulting in no game limitation or
priority based on that field.  The game "default" controls the settings for
any game not otherwise listed, and must be the last ``game'' entry in the
file.  Priorities may not be negative.  For example, the following entries
limits the game ``hack'' to running only when the system has 10 or less
users and a load average of 5 or less; all other games may be run any time
the system has 15 or less users.
.PP
