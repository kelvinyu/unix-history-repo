Brian Horn (cithep!bdh) showed me a
.I TOPS-20
program on the DEC-2136 machine called
.IR WORM ,
and suggested that I write a similar program that would run under
.IR Unix .
I did, and no apologies.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.I -f
makes a ``field'' for the worm(s) to eat.
.TP
.I -t

You can figure out the rest by yourself.
