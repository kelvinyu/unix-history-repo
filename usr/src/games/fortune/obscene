Build a better mousetrap, the saying goes -- and with the brassiere,
Yankee Ingenuity did exactly that.  But their true stroke of genius was
the new bait.  The old fashioned mousetrap was loaded with cheese;
nobody cares much about cheese, except mice.  But when American
Know-How reloaded the brassiere with tits, every heterosexual male in
the country was hopelessy trapped.

	"God built a compeling sex drive into every creature, no
matter what style of fucking it practiced.  He made sex irresistibly
preasurable, wildly joyous, free from fears.  He made it innocent
merriment.
	"Needelss to say, fucking was an immediate smash hit.  Everyone
agreed, from aardvarks to zebras.  All the jolly animals -- lions and
lambs, rhinoceroses and bazelles, skylarks and lobsteres, even insects,
though most of them fuck only once in a lifetime -- fucked along
innocently and merrily for hundreds of millions of years.  Maybe they
were dumb animals, but they knew a good thing when they had one."

	Them Toad Suckers

How 'bout them toad suckers, ain't they clods?
Sittin' there suckin' them green toady frogs!

Suckin' them hop toads, suckin' them chunkers,
Suckin' them a leapy type, suckin' them flunkers.

Look at them toad suckers, ain't they snappy?
Suckin' them bog frogs sure make's 'em happy!

Them hugger mugger toad suckers, way down south,
Stickin' them sucky toads in they mouth!

How to be a toad sucker, no way to duck it,
Get yourself a toad, rear back, and suck it!

they spake unto their Division Head, saying, "It is a crock of shit,

	And the Division Head spake unto his Department Head, saying,
"It is a crock of excrement and none may abide the odor thereof."  Now,
the Department Head spake unto his Directorate Head, saying, "It is a
container of excrement, and is very strong, such that none may abide
before it."  And it came to pass that the Directorate Head spake unto
the Assistant Technical Director, saying, "It is a vessel of fertilizer
and none may abide by its strength."

Technical Director, saying, "It containeth that which aids growth and
it is very strong."  And, Lo, the Technical Director spake then unto

growth of the Laboratories."

CLONE OF MY OWN (to Home on the Range)

Oh, give me a clone
Of my own flesh and bone
	With the Y chromosome changed to X.
And when she is grown,
My very own clone,
	We'll be of the opposite sex.

Chorus:
	Clone, clone of my own,
	With the Y chromosome changed to X.
	And when we're alone,
	Since her mind is my own,
	She'll be thinking of nothing but sex.

All things dull and ugly,
   All creatures short and squat,
   All things rude and nasty,
   The Lord God made the lot;
Each little snake that poisons,
   Each little wasp that stings,
   He made their brutish venom,
   He made their horrid wings.
All things sick and cancerous,
   All evil great and small,
   All things foul and dangerous,
   The Lord God made them all.
Each nasty little hornet,
   Each beastly little squid.
   Who made the spikey urchin?
   Who made the sharks? He did.
All things scabbed and ulcerous,
   All pox both great and small.
   Putrid, foul and gangrenous,
   The Lord God made them all.

And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart:

Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed;

But a bugger when he's pissed!
