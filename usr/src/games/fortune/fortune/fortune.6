.SH NAME
fortune \- print a random, hopefully interesting, adage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/fortune
[
.B \-
] [
.B \-fwslaoe
]
[
.B \-m
.I pattern
.B \-i
]
[ [ \fIN\fP% ] \fIfile\fP/\fIdir\fP/\fBall\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When
.I fortune
is run with no arguments
it prints out a random epigram. The flags mean:
.PP
.TP 5
.B \-f
Print out the list of files
which would be searched,
but don't print a fortune.
.B \-w
Wait before termination
for an amount of time calculated from the number of characters in the message.
This is useful if it is executed as part of the logout procedure
to guarantee that the message can be read before the screen is cleared.
.TP 5
.B \-s
Short apothegms only.
.TP 5
.B \-l
Long dictums only.
.TP
.B \-o
Choose from an alternate list of aphorisms,
often used for potentially offensive ones.
.TP
.B \-a
Choose from either list of maxims.
.TP
.B \-m
Print out all fortunes which match the regular expression
.I pattern .
See
.BR regex (3)
or
.BR regcmp (3)
for description of patterns.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore case for
.B \-m
patterns.
.TP
.B \-e
Consider all fortune files to be of equal size
(see below on multiple files).
.PP
The user may specify alternate sayings.
You can specify a specific file,
a directory which contains one or more files,
or the special word
.B all
which says to use all the standard databases.
The files must be created
using
.B strfile (8) .
Any of these may be preceded by a percentage,
which is a number
.I N
between 0 and 100 inclusive,
followed by a
.B % .
If it is,
there will be a
.I N
percent probability
that an adage will be picked from that file or directory.
If the percentages
do not sum to 100,
and there are specifications without percentages,
the remaining percent
will apply to those files and/or directories,
in which case
the probability of selecting from one of them
will be based on their relative sizes.
.PP
As an example,
given two databases
.B funny
and
.B not-funny ,
with
.B funny
twice as big,
saying
.RS
fortune funny not-funny
.RE
will get you fortunes out of
.B funny
two-thirds of the time.
The command
.RS
fortune 90% funny 10% not-funny
.RE
will pick out 90% of its fortunes from
.B funny
(the ``10% not-funny'' is unecessary,
since 10% is all that's left).
The
.B \-e
option says to consider all files equal;
thus
.RS
fortune \-e
.RE
is equivalent to
.RS
fortune 50% funny 50% not-funny
.RE
