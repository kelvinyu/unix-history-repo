.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Gomoku
is a two player game were the object is to get 5 in a row horizontally,
vertically or diagonally on a 19 by 19 grid. By convention, black always
moves first.
With no arguments,
.Nm gomoku
will display a playing board and prompt for moves from the user.
Valid moves are a letter for the column and a number for the row of an empty
board location. Entering ``quit" or ``resign" will end the game.
You can save the current state of the game by entering ``save" and
supplying a file name when prompted.
The optional file
.Ar inputfile
can be used to restore a saved game.

The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

This option sets background mode. Input moves are read from standard input,
the computer picks a move, and prints it to standard output. The first
input line should be either ``black" or ``white" to specify whether
.Nm gomoku
has the first move or not respectively. This
option was intended for game tournaments where a referee program handles
the board display and pits one program against another.
