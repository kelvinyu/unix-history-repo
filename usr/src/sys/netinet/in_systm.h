 * The network runs as a software interrupt process.
 * You can switch into the network by doing splnet() and return by splx().
 * The software interrupt level for the network is higher than the software
 * level for the clock (so you can enter the network in routines called
 * at timeout time).  Splimp is an ipl high enough to block all imps.
 * While manipulating the mbuf buffer pool you have to block imps since
 * allocation occurs at interrupt level.  (It would be easier to
 * use interlocked instructions, but we don't do this yet.)
