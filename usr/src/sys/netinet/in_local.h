/*
 * Local subnetwork address mapping.
 * The standard scheme is:
 *	internet address = network.local-part
 * where
 *	network is between 8 and 34 bits
 *	local-part is between 8 and 24 bits
 *
 * This is modified by interpreting network as 32 bits
 * and local-part as something between 8 and 23 bits
 * depending on the high bit in the local-part.  When
 * the high bit in the local-part is a 1, the upper byte
 * is interpreted as a local network extension, and used
 * as the high byte in the network (extending it to 32 bits).
 * The additional 8 bits of network number are administered
 * locally and are not visible outside Berkeley, since
 * they're part of the local-part.
