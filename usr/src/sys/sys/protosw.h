/*
 * Protocol switch table.
 *
 * Each protocol has a handle initializing one of these structures,
 * which is used for protocol-protocol and system-protocol communication.
 *
 * A protocol is called through the pr_init entry before any other.
 * Thereafter it is called every 100ms through the pr_fasttimo entry and
 * every 500ms through the pr_slowtimo for timer based actions.
 * The system will call the pr_drain entry if it is low on space and
 * this should throw away any non-critical data.
 *
 * Protocols pass data between themselves as chains of mbufs using
 * the pr_input and pr_output hooks.  Pr_input passes data up (towards
 * UNIX) and pr_output passes it down (towards the imps); control
 * information passes up and down on pr_ctlinput and pr_ctloutput.
 * The protocol is responsible for the space occupied by any the
 * arguments to these entries and must dispose it.
 *
 * The userreq routine interfaces protocols to the system and is
 * described below.
 *
 * The sense routine returns protocol status into the argument buffer.
 * This is used by the system in providing session-level abstractions
 * out of network level protocols, and may also be returned by socket ioctl's.
 * The amount of data returned by a sense is limited to the maxsense
 * value.  (The space for the sense is allocated by the caller, based on this.)
