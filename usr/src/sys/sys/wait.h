 * which stop due to signals.  If children are stopped and a wait without
 * this option is done, it is as though they were still running... nothing
 * about them is returned.   By default, a blocking wait call will be
 * aborted by receipt of a signal that is caught (POSIX); the option
 * WSIGRESTART causes the call to restart instead of failing with error EINTR.
