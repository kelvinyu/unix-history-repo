/*
 * Fraction of text space to allocate for from hash buckets.
 * The value of HASHFRACTION is based on the minimum number of bytes
 * of separation between two subroutine call points in the object code.
 * Given MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION bytes of separation the value of
 * HASHFRACTION is calculated as:
 *
 *	HASHFRACTION = MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION / (2 * sizeof(short) - 1);
 *
 * For example, on the VAX, the shortest two call sequence is:
 *
 *	calls	$0,(r0)
 *	calls	$0,(r0)
 *
 * which is separated by only three bytes, thus HASHFRACTION is 
 * calculated as:
 *
 *	HASHFRACTION = 3 / (2 * 2 - 1) = 1
 *
 * Note that the division above rounds down, thus if MIN_SUBR_FRACTION
 * is less than three, this algorithm will not work!
 *
 * In practice, however, call instructions are rarely at a minimal 
 * distance.  Hence, we will define HASHFRACTION to be 2 across all
 * architectures.  This saves a reasonable amount of space for 
 * profiling data structures without (in practice) sacrificing
 * any granularity.
