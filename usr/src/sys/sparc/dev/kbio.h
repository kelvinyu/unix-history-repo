/*
 * The following is a minimal emulation of Sun's `kio' structures
 * and related operations necessary to make X11 happy (i.e., make it
 * compile, and make old X11 binaries run).
 */

/*
 * The kiockey structure apparently gets and/or sets keyboard mappings.
 * It seems to be kind of useless, but X11 uses it (according to the
 * comments) to figure out when a Sun 386i has a type-4 keyboard but
 * claims to have a type-3 keyboard.  We need just enough to cause the
 * appropriate ioctl to return the appropriate magic value.
 *
 * KIOCGETKEY fills in kio_entry from kio_station.  Not sure what tablemask
 * is for; X sets it before the call, so it is not an output, but we do not
 * care anyway.  KIOCSDIRECT is supposed to tell the kernel whether to send
 * keys to the console or to X; we just send them to X whenever the keyboard
 * is open at all.  (XXX may need to change this later)
 *
 * Keyboard commands and types are defined in kbd.h as they are actually
 * real hardware commands and type numbers.
