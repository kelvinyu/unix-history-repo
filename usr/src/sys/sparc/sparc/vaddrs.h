/*
 * Special (fixed) virtual addresses on the SPARC.
 *
 * IO virtual space begins at 0xfe000000 (a segment boundary) and
 * continues up to the DMVA edge at 0xff000000.  (The upper all-1s
 * byte is special since some of the hardware supplies this to pad
 * a 24-bit address space out to 32 bits.  This is a legacy of the
 * IBM PC AT bus, actually, just so you know who to blame.)
 *
 * We reserve several pages at the base of our IO virtual space
 * for `oft-used' devices which must be present anyway in order to
 * configure.  In particular, we want the counter-timer register and
 * the Zilog ZSCC serial port chips to be mapped at fixed VAs to make
 * microtime() and the zs hardware interrupt handlers faster.
 *
 * Ideally, we should map the interrupt enable register here as well,
 * but that would require allocating pmegs in locore.s, so instead we
 * use one of the two `wasted' pages at KERNBASE+2*NBPG (see locore.s).
