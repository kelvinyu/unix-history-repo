I'm using NWS-3200 laptop machine for development.  Only 3200's LCD display
is supported now.  You can use on 3400 by serial line console, but it is not
tested well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
config command is not changed to support NEWS because it will be changed
to support dual processor machine in future.  Diffs are in config.diff
in /sys/news3400 directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC 2.x has problem to build library objects.  Usually library object is made
by following way.

	cc -c x.c
	ld -r -x x.o
	mv a.out x.o

But using gcc 2.x (at least 2.2.2), some object made by this can't be
lordable.  ld complains that the object has bad isym.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs:
	- Floating point doesn't work.
	- Display driver is slow.
	- Serial line driver is slow.
	- Reboot doesn't work.
	- NFS doesn't work (it worked before...)
