This Sony RISC workstation support is done as an activity in WIDE research
project.  Sony Corp. contributed device drivers and gave us great
technical supports.  Kazumasa Utashiro worked mainly for 4.4-alpha porting
but that work was based on 4.3-Reno port helped by other project members,
Tadamichi Matsuyama and Hidetoshi Unno.

This version is just a snapshot of developing system and has many
unimplemented feature and bugs.  Please contact utashiro@sra.co.jp if you
have any comment about this code.  Bugfix will be greatly appreciated.

I've been using NWS-3200 laptop machine and NWS-3400 for development.  3200's
LCD display and NWB-253 display board are supported now.

GCC 2.x has a problem to build library objects.  Usually library object is
made by following way:

	cc -c x.c
	ld -r -x x.o
	mv a.out x.o

But using gcc 2.x (at least 2.2.2), some objects made by this way can't be
linked.  ld complains that the object has bad isym.

Known bugs:
	- Display driver is slow.
	- Serial line driver is slow.
	- Console doesn't accept ^S.
