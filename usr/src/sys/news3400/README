I'm using NWS-3200 laptop machine for development.  Only 3200's LCD display
is supported now.  You can use this kernel on 3400 by serial line console,
but it is not tested well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Config command is not changed to support NEWS because it will be changed
to support dual processor machine in the future.  Diffs are in CONFIG.DIFF
in /sys/news3400 directory.

GCC 2.x has a problem to build library objects.  Usually library object is
made by following way:

	cc -c x.c
	ld -r -x x.o
	mv a.out x.o

But using gcc 2.x (at least 2.2.2), some objects made by this way can't be
linked.  ld complains that the object has bad isym.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs:
	- Floating point doesn't work always.
	- Display driver is slow.
	- Serial line driver is slow.
	- Reboot doesn't work.
	- NFS doesn't work (it worked before...)
	- System hangs when ^S is typed from bitmap console.
