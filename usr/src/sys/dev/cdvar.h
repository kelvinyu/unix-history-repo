/*
 * Interleave description table.
 * Computed at boot time to speed irregular-interleave lookups.
 * The idea is that we interleave in "groups".  First we interleave
 * evenly over all component disks up to the size of the smallest
 * component (the first group), then we interleave evenly over all
 * remaining disks up to the size of the next-smallest (second group),
 * and so on.
 *
 * Each table entry describes the interleave characteristics of one
 * of these groups.  For example if a concatenated disk consisted of
 * three components of 5, 3, and 7 DEV_BSIZE blocks interleaved at
 * DEV_BSIZE (1), the table would have three entries:
 *
 *	ndisk	startblk	startoff	dev
 *	3	0		0		0, 1, 2
 *	2	9		3		0, 2
 *	1	13		5		2
 *	0	-		-		-
 *
 * which says that the first nine blocks (0-8) are interleaved over
 * 3 disks (0, 1, 2) starting at block offset 0 on any component disk,
 * the next 4 blocks (9-12) are interleaved over 2 disks (0, 2) starting
 * at component block 3, and the remaining blocks (13-14) are on disk
 * 2 starting at offset 5.
