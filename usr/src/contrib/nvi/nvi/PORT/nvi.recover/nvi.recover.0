     The nnvvii..rreeccoovveerr utility sends mail to users about files which they were
     editing with nvi(1) when the system crashed, the editor received a
     SIGHUP, or the user requested preservation of the file.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd      Look in the specified directory instead of the default
             ``/var/tmp/vi.recover''.

     File names are expected to be of the form ``vi.file.123456'', where
     ``file'' is the last component of the name of the file the user was edit-
     ing and ``123456'' is a random string of digits.
