Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.24.7 to 1.26.2:

    There is a new emacs-like command line editing and edit history
    feature.  The old history mechanism has been removed.  The key
    bindings for the new editing commands are slightly configurable
    since they are read in from an initialization file.  This file is
    usually called /usr/lib/calc/bindings, but can be changed by the
    CALCBINDINGS environment variable.  All editing code is
    self-contained in the new files hist.c and hist.h, which can be
    easily extracted and used in other programs.

    Two new library files have been added: chrem.cal and cryrand.cal.
    The first of these solves the chinese remainder problem for a set
    of modulos and remainders.  The second of these implements several
    very good random number generators for large numbers.

    A small bug which allowed division by zero was fixed.

    A major bug in the mattrans function was fixed.

    A major bug in the acos function for negative arguments was fixed.

    A major bug in the strprintf function when objects were being printed
    was fixed.

    A small bug in the library file regress.cal was fixed.
