.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mount
announces to the system that a removable file system is present on the
block device \fIspecial\fP or the remote node ``rhost:path''. 
The file \fInode\fP must exist already and
it must be a directory.  It becomes the name of the newly mounted root.
The optional arguments \fI-r\fP and \fI-w\fP indicate that the file
system is to be mounted read-only or read-write, respectively.  If
either \fIspecial\fP or \fIfile\fP are not provided, the appropriate
information is taken from the \fIfstab\fP file.  The \fI-f\fP option
causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's
not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the file system.
The optional argument \fI-t\fP must be followed by \fBnfs\fP or
\fBufs\fP to indicate the file system type. The type \fBufs\fP is
the default.
The \fI-o\fP argument followed by \fIoptions\fP, which is a comma
separated string of any of the following list,
can be used to override the defaults for an nfs mount.
.PP
.IP "hard" 12
I/O system calls will retry until the server responds (default)
.IP "soft" 12
I/O system calls will fail and return errno after \fIretrans\fP request
retransmissions
.IP "bg" 12
If the first mount request times out, do retries in background
.IP "intr" 12
I/O system calls can be interrupted.
.IP "rsize=#" 12
Set read size to \fI#\fP bytes.
.IP "wsize=#" 12
Set write size to \fI#\fP bytes.
.IP "retry=#" 12
Set mount retry count to \fI#\fP.
.IP "retrans=#" 12
Set retransmission count for nfs rpc's to \fI#\fP.
.IP "timeo=#" 12
Set initial nfs timeout to \fI#\fP in 0.1 sec intervals.
.fi
.PP
.I Umount
announces to the system that the removable file system \fInode\fP
or whatever removable file system was previously mounted on device
\fIspecial\fP should be removed.
.PP
If the \fI-a\fP option is present for either
.I mount
or
.I umount,
all of the file systems described in
.I fstab
are mounted or unmounted.
.PP
The system maintains a list of currently mounted filesystems.
If invoked without an argument,
.I mount
prints the list.
.PP
Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file
systems must be mounted read-only
or errors will occur when access times are updated,
whether or not any explicit write is attempted.
.SH FILES
/etc/fstab	file system table
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mount(2), fstab(5)
.SH BUGS
Mounting garbaged file systems will crash the system.
.PP
Mounting a root directory on a non-directory
makes some apparently good pathnames invalid.
