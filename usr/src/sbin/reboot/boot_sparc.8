.Nm reboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 .
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts
The SPARC system currently uses the SunOS bootstrap loaders.
This will be changed in a future version of the system.
The SunOS boot will attempt to load
.Pa vmunix
from partition A of the boot device,
which must currently be an ``sd'' disk.
.Pp
The
.Op Fl s
flag to the SunOS boot loader will being the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Op Fl d
flag to the SunOS boot loader will bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr kgdb 8 .
Other flags are currently ignored.

The use of Sun disk labels, without the ability to write them,
is problematic.
