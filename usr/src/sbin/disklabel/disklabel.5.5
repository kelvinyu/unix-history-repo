.SH NAME
disklabel \- disk pack label
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/disklabel.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each disk or disk pack on a system may contain a disk label
which provides detailed information
about the geometry of the disk and the partitions into which the disk
is divided.
It should be initialized when the disk is formatted,
and may be changed later with the
.IR disklabel (8)
program.
This information is used by the system disk driver and by the bootstrap
program to determine how to program the drive
and where to find the filesystems on the disk partitions.
Additional information is used by the filesystem in order
to use the disk most efficiently and to locate important filesystem information.
The label is located in sector number
.I LABELSECTOR
of the drive, usually sector 0 where it may be found
without any information about the disk geometry.
It is at an offset
.I LABELOFFSET
from the beginning of the sector, to allow room for the initial bootstrap.
The format of the disk label, as specified in
.RI < sys/disklabel.h >,
is
.nf
.DT
.so /usr/include/sys/disklabel.h
