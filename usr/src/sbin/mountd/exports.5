.Sh NAME
.Nm exports
.Nd define remote mount points for
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm exports
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm exports
file
specifies remote mount points for the
.Tn NFS
mount protocol per the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification \\*(tNRFC\\*(sP 1094" .
.Pp
Each line in the file specifies one remote mount point.
The first field is the mount point directory path followed
optionally by export options and specific hosts separated by white space.
Only the first entry for a given local file system may specify the export
options, since these are handled on a
.Em per local file system
basis.
If no specific hosts are specified,
the mount point is exported to all hosts.
.Pp
The export options are as follows:
.Sm off
.Fl root No = Aq Sy uid
.Sm on
specifies how to map root's uid (default -2).
The option
.Fl r
is synonyms for
.Fl root
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.Pp
.Fl ro
specifies that the file system should be exported Read-only
(default Read/Write).
The option
.Fl o
is synonyms for
.Fl ro
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr -root=0 rickers snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
/usr/local 131.104.48.16
/u -root=5
/u2 -ro
.Ed
.Pp
Given that
.Sy /usr ,
.Sy /u
and
.Sy /u2
are
local file system mount points, the above example specifies the following:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Sy /usr
is exported to hosts
.Em rickers
and
.Em snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
with
root mapped to root.
.Pp
.Sy /usr/local
is exported to host
.Em 131.104.48.16
with root mapped to root.
.Pp
.Sy /u
is exported to all hosts with root mapped to uid 5.
.Pp
.Sy /u2
is exported to all hosts Read-only with root mapped to -2.
.Ed
.Pp
Note that
.Dq Li "/usr/local -root=5"
would have been incorrect,
since
.Sy /usr
and
.Sy /usr/local
reside in the same local file system.
