.SH NAME
nfsd \- remote NFS server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/nfsd
[
.B numdaemons
[
.B filtermask
.B filtervalue
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nfsd
runs on a server machine to service
.SM NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.I nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
The option
.I numdaemons
defines how many
.I nfsd
daemons to start;
if unspecified, only a single daemon will be started.
A server should typically run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.PP
The options
.I filtermask
and
.I filtervalue
may be specified to restrict the clients serviced by filtering incoming
source addresses.
They are expressed in Internet standard "." notation.
The algorithm is simply:
.sp
.RS
if ((filtermask & source_addr) == filtervalue)
.RS
.I accept request
.RE
.RE
.sp
The default values for filtermask and filtervalue are 0, which accepts
requests from all client source_addr's.
Alternately, the most secure values you could use for
.I filtermask
and
.I filtervalue
would be:
.sp
.RS
filtervalue = (inet_addr1 & inet_addr2 & ... & inet_addrN)
.br
filtermask = ~(inet_addr1 | inet_addr2 | ... | inet_addrN) | filtervalue
.RE
.sp
although your subnet or net number and mask will be just as good
in most cases.
.PP
.I Nfsd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.SM NFS
server specification; see
``Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC1094''
