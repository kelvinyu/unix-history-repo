.SH NAME
nfsiod \- local NFS asynchronous I/O server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/nfsiod
[
.B numservers
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nfsiod
runs on an
.SM NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to its server.
It improves performance but is not required for correct operation.
The option
.I numservers
defines how many
.I nfsiod
daemons to start.
A client should typically run enough servers to handle
their maximum level of concurrency,
typically four to six.
