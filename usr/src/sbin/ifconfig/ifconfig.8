.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ifconfig
is used to assign an address
to a network interface and/or configure
network interface parameters.
.I Ifconfig
must be used at boot time to define the network address
of each interface present on a machine; it may also be used at
a later time to redefine an interface's address.  The
.I interface
parameter is a string of the form ``name unit'', e.g. ``en0''.
.LP
Since an interface may receive transmissions in differing protocols,
each of which may required separate naming schemes, it is necessary
to specify the
.IR protocol_family ,
which may change the interpretation of the remaining parameters.
The address protocols current supported are ``inet'' and ``ns''.
.LP
For the DARPA-Internet family,
the address is either a host name present in the host name data
base, 
.IR hosts (5),
or a DARPA Internet address expressed in the Internet standard
``dot notation''.
For the Xerox Network Systems(tm) family,
addresses are 
.IR net:a.b.c.d.e.f ,
where
.I net
is the assigned network number (in decimal),
and each of the six bytes are specified in hexadecimal.
.PP
The following parameters may be set with 
.IR ifconfig :
.TP 15
.B up
Mark an interface ``up''. 
.TP 15
.B down
Mark an interface ``down''.  When an interface is
marked ``down'', the system will not attempt to
transmit messages through that interface. 
.TP 15
.B trailers
Enable the use of a ``trailer'' link level encapsulation when
sending (default).
If a network interface supports
.IR trailers ,
the system will, when possible, encapsulate outgoing
messages in a manner which minimizes the number of
memory to memory copy operations performed by the receiver.
.TP 15
.B \-trailers
Disable the use of a ``trailer'' link level encapsulation.
.TP 15
.B arp
Enable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol in mapping
between network level addresses and link level addresses (default). 
This is currently implemented for mapping between DARPA Internet
addresses and 10Mb/s Ethernet addresses.
.TP 15
.B \-arp
Disable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol.
.TP 15
.B debug
Enable driver dependent debugging code; usually, this turns on
extra console error logging.
.TP 15
.B \-debug
Disable driver dependent debugging code.
.TP 15
.B netmask
Specify how much of the address you wish to reserve for subdiving
Class A and B networks into sub-networks.
(Inet only).
.TP 15
.B dstaddr
Specify the correspondent on the other end of a point to point link
.TP 15
.B broadcast
Specify the address you wish to use to represent broadcasts to the
network.
.TP 15
.B ipdst
This is used to specify an internet host who is willing to receive
ip packets encapsulating ns packets bound for a remote network.
In this case, an apparent point to point link is constructed, and
the address you specify will be taken as the ns address and network
of the destinee.
.PP
.I Ifconfig
displays the current configuration for a network interface
when no optional parameters are supplied.
If a protocol family is specified,
Ifconfig will report only the details specific to that protocol family.
.PP
Only the super-user may modify the configuration of a network interface.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.
