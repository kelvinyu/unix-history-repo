.SH NAME
ttys \- terminal initialization data
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ttys
file contains information that is used by various routines to initialize
and control the use of terminal special files. This information is read
with the
.IR getttyent (3)
library routines.
There is one line in the 
.I ttys
file per special file.
Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
A field of more than one word may be enclosed by quotes.
Blank lines and comments can appear anywhere in the file; comments
are delimited by `#' and new line. Unspecified fields default to
the empty string or zero as appropriate.
The first field is the terminal's entry in the device directory, /dev.
The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,
typically
.IR getty (8),
which performs such tasks as baud-rate recognition, reading the login name,
and calling
.IR login (1).
It can be, however, any command you wish, for example
the start up for a window system terminal emulator or maintain other
daemon processes.
The third field is the type of terminal normally connected to the
terminal special file as found in the
.IR termcap (5)
data base file.
The remaining fields are flags to be set in the
.I ty_status
entry (see
.IR getttyent (3))
or for a window system process indicated by
the "window" keyword that
.IR init(8)
will maintain for the terminal line.
If the line ends in a comment, the comment is included in the
.I ty_comment
field of the ttyent structure.
.PP
Some examples:
.PP
.nf
console "/etc/getty std.1200" vt100 on secure
ttyd0 "/etc/getty d1200" dialup on
ttyh0 "/etc/getty std.9600" hp2621-nl on
ttyh1 "/etc/getty std.9600" plugboard on
ttyp0 none network
ttyp1 none network off
ttyv0 "/etc/xpty -L :0" vs100 on window="/etc/X 0"
.fi
.PP
The first example permits root login on the console at 1200 baud,
the second allows dialup at 1200 baud without root login,
the third and fourth allow login at 9600 baud with terminal types of
"hp2621-nl" and "plugboard" respectively,
the fifth and sixth line are examples of network pseudo ttys, which
should not have getty enabled on them,
and the last example shows a terminal emulator and window system
startup entry.
