.Sh NAME
.Nm rbootd
.Nd HP remote boot server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rbootd
.Op Fl ad
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op config_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rbootd
utility services boot requests from Hewlett-Packard workstations over a
local area network.
All boot files must reside in the boot file directory; further, if a
client supplies path information in its boot request, it will be silently
stripped away before processing.
By default,
.Nm rbootd
only responds to requests from machines listed in its configuration file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
Respond to boot requests from any machine.
The configuration file is ignored if this option is specified.
.It Fl d
Run
.Nm rbootd
in debug mode.
Packets sent and received are displayed to the terminal.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Service boot requests on specified interface.
If unspecified,
.Nm rbootd
searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured
``up'' interface (excluding loopback).
Ties are broken by choosing the earliest match.
.El
.Pp
Specifying
.Ar config_file
on the command line causes
.Nm rbootd
to use a different configuration file from the default.
.Pp
The configuration file is a text file where each line describes a particular
machine.
A line must start with a machine's Ethernet address followed by an optional
list of boot file names.
An ethernet address is specified in hexadecimal with each of its six octets
separated by a colon.
The boot file names come from the boot file directory.
The ethernet address and boot file(s) must be separated by white-space
and/or comma characters.
A pound sign causes the remainder of a line to be ignored.
.Pp
Here is a sample configuration file:
.Bl -column 08:00:09:0:66:ad SYSHPBSD,SYSHPUX "# vandy (anything)"
.It #
.It # ethernet addr	boot file(s)	comments
.It #
.It 08:00:09:0:66:ad	SYSHPBSD	# snake (4.3BSD)
.It 08:00:09:0:59:5b		# vandy (anything)
.It 8::9:1:C6:75	SYSHPBSD,SYSHPUX	# jaguar (either)
.El
.Pp
.Nm Rbootd
logs status and error messages via
.Xr syslog 3 .
A startup message is always logged, and in the case of fatal errors (or
deadly signals) a message is logged announcing the server's termination.
In general, a non-fatal error is handled by ignoring the event that caused
it (e.g. an invalid Ethernet address in the config file causes that line
to be invalidated).
.Pp
The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the server
process using the
.Xr kill 1
command:
.Bl -tag -width SIGUSR1 -offset -compact
.It SIGHUP
Drop all active connections and reconfigure.
.It SIGUSR1
Turn on debugging, do nothing if already on.
.It SIGUSR2
Turn off debugging, do nothing if already off.
.El
.Sh "FILES"
.Bl -tag -width /usr/libexec/rbootd -compact
.It /dev/bpf#
packet-filter device
.It /etc/rbootd.conf
configuration file
.It /tmp/rbootd.dbg
debug output
.It /usr/mdec/rbootd
directory containing boot files
.It /var/run/rbootd.pid
process id

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kill 1 ,
.Xr socket 2 ,
.Xr signal 3 ,
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr rmp 4
.Sh BUGS
If multiple servers are started on the same interface, each will receive
and respond to the same boot packets.
