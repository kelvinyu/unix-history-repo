.SH DESCRIPTION
The MPCC has two different connecter panel styles.
The 16 port MPCC will support any combination of SYNC or ASYNC ports.
The 32 port MPCC will only support ASYNC ports.
Each async line attached to the MPCC communications controller
behaves as described in
.IR tty (7)
and may be set to run at any of 16 speeds; see
.IR tty (7)
for the encoding.
.PP
Each MPCC controller uses 2 entries in the SCB for download/handshake,
and command/response interrupts.
These entries start at 0xa0 for the 1st controllers download/handshake
interrupts thru 0xaf, and 0xb0 for the 1st controllers command/response
interrupts thru 0xbf.
