orderlist symbolfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Orderlist
is a file containing symbols to be found in symbolfile,
1 symbol per line.

.I Symbolfile
is updated in place to put the requested symbols first
in the symbol table, in the order specified.  This is done
by swapping the old symbols in the required spots with the
new ones.  If all of the order symbols are not found, an
error is generated.
.PP
This program was specifically designed to cut down on the
overhead of getting symbols from /vmunix.
