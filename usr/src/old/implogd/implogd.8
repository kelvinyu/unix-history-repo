.SH NAME
implogd \- IMP logger process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/implogd
[
.B \-d
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Implogd
is program which logs messages from the IMP,
placing them in the file
.IR /usr/adm/implog .
.PP
Entries in the file are variable length.  Each log
entry has a fixed length header of the form:
.PP
.ta 0.5i 1.0i 1.5i
.nf
struct sockstamp {
	short	sin_family;
	u_short	sin_port;
	struct	in_addr sin_addr;
	time_t	sin_time;
	int	sin_len;
};
.fi
.PP
followed, possibly, by the message received from the 
IMP.  Each time the logging process is started up it
places a time stamp entry in the file (a header with
.I sin_len
field set to 0).
.PP
The logging process will catch only those message from
the IMP which are not processed by a protocol module,
e.g. IP.  This implies the log should contain only
status information such as ``IMP going down'' messages
and, perhaps, stray NCP messages.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
imp(4P),
implog(8C)
.SH BUGS
The messages should probably be sent to the system error
logging process instead of maintaining yet another log file.
