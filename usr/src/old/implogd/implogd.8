.Sh NAME
.Nm implogd
.Nd
.Tn IMP
logger process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm implogd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Implogd
is program which logs error messages from an
.Tn IMP ,
placing them in the file
.Pa /var/log/implog .
.Pp
Entries in the file are variable length.  Each log
entry has a fixed length header of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sockstamp {
	short	sin_family;
	u_short	sin_port;
	struct	in_addr sin_addr;
	time_t	sin_time;
	int	sin_len;
};
.Ed
.Pp
followed, possibly, by the message received from the
.Tn IMP .
Each time the logging process is started up it places a
time stamp entry in the file (a header with
.Ar sin_len
field set to 0).
.Pp
The logging process will catch only those messages from the
.Tn IMP
which are not processed by a protocol module, e.g. IP.
This implies the log should contain only status information such
as
.Dq Tn IMP No going down
messages,
.Dq host down
and other error messages,
and, perhaps, stray
.Tn NCP
messages.
