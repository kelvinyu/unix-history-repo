.SH NAME
arff \- floppy archiver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arff
[ key ] [ name ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Arff
saves and restores files
on VAX console media (the console floppy on the VAX 11/780 and 785,
the cassette on the 11/730, and the console RL02 on the 8600/8650).
Its actions are controlled by the
.I key
argument.
The
.I key
is a string of characters containing
at most one function letter and possibly
one or more function modifiers.
Other arguments to the command are file
names specifying which files are to be dumped or restored.
The default options are correct for the RX01 floppy on the 780;
for other console media, the
.B f
and
.B m
flags are required.
.PP
Files names have restrictions, because of radix50 considerations.  They
must be in the form 1-6 alphanumerics followed by "." followed by
0-3 alphanumerics.  Case distinctions are lost.  Only the trailing component
of a pathname is used.
.PP
The function portion of
the key is specified by one of the following letters:
.TP 8
.B  r
The named files
are replaced where found on the floppy, or added taking up
the minimal possible portion of the first empty spot on the floppy.
.TP 8
.B  x
The named files are extracted from the floppy.
.TP 8
.B  d
The named files are deleted from the floppy.  Arff will combine contiguous
deleted files into one empty entry in the rt-11 directory.
.TP 8
.B  t
The names of the specified files are listed each time they occur
on the floppy.
If no file argument is given,
all of the names on the floppy are listed.
.PP
The following characters may be used in addition to the letter
which selects the function desired.
.TP 10
.B  v
The
.B v
(verbose)
option, when used with the
.B t
function gives more information about the
floppy entries than just the name.
.TP 10
.B f
causes 
.I arff
to use the next argument as the name of the archive instead
of /dev/floppy. 
.TP 10
.B m
causes
.I arff
not to use the mapping algorithm employed in interleaving sectors
around a floppy disk.  In conjunction with the 
.B f
option it may be
used for extracting files from rt11 formatted cartridge disks, for
example.
It may also be used to speed up reading from and writing to 
rx02 floppy disks, by using the `c' device instead of the `b' device.
It must be used with TU58 or RL02 media.
.TP 10
.B c
causes
.I arff
to create a new directory on the floppy, effectively deleting
all previously existing files.
.SH FILES
