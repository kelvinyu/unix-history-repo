.Nm vlp

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Vlp
formats the named files so that they can be run through
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr vtroff 1 ,
or
.Xr troff 1
to produce listings that line-up and are attractive.
The first non-blank character of each line is lined-up vertically,
as in the source file.
Comments (text beginning with a semicolon)
are printed in italics.
Each function's name is printed in bold face next to the function.
This format makes Lisp code look attractive when it is printed with a 
variable width font.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm vlp
works as a filter and sends its output to the standard output.
However,
the 
.Fl v
switch pipes the output directly to vtroff.
If no files are specified,
then
.Nm vlp
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
The 
.Fl d
switch puts
.Nm vlp
into debugging mode.
.It Fl f
.Nm Vlp
has a filtered mode
in which all lines are passed unmodified,
except those lines between the directives
.Sy .Ls
and
.Sy .Le .
This mode can be used to format Lisp code that is embedded in a document.
The directive
.Sy .Ls
takes an optional argument that gives the point
size for the embedded code.
If not size is specified,
the size of the surrounding text is used.
.It Fl l
The
.Fl l
switch prevents
.Nm vlp
from placing labels next to functions.
This switch is useful for embedded Lisp code,
where the labels would be distracting.
.It Fl p Ar pointsize
The
.Fl p
switch changes the size of the text from its default value of 8 points
to one of 6, 8, 10, or 12 points.
Once set, the point size is used for all subsequent files.
This point size does not apply to embedded text (see
.Fl f
above).
.It Fl v
This switch cause
.Nm vlp
to send its output to vtroff rather than the
standard output.
.It Fl T Ar title
A title to be printed on each page may be specified by using the 
.Fl T
switch.
The 
.Fl T
switch applies only to the next
.Ar file
name given.
Titles are not printed for embedded text (see 
.Fl f ,
above).
This switch may not be used if
.Nm vlp
is reading from the standard input.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm vlp
transforms
.Ql \e
into
.Ql \e\e
so that it will be printed out.
Hence,
.Xr troff
commands cannot be embedded in Lisp code.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
