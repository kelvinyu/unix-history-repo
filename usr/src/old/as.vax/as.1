.Sh NAME
.Nm as
.Nd VAX-11 assembler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm as
.Op Fl \&a Ar val
.Op Fl \&d Ar bytes
.Op Fl \&L
.Op Fl \&W
.Op Fl \&V
.Op Fl \&J
.Op Fl \&R
.Op Fl \&t Ar directory
.Op Fl \&o Ar outfile
.Op Ar source_file(s)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm as
assembler produces an object file from the given source files
or from the standard input.
.Tp Fl a
Specifies the alignment
.Ar value
of procedures and data blocks.
It is given as a power of two; thus an alignment of 3
causes alignment on an eight byte boundary.
The default is
.Cx Fl a
.Li 2
.Cx ,
.Cx
the minumum value is
.Li 1 ,
the maximum value
.Li 16 .
.Tp Fl d
Displacement offset in bytes for displacement values
not defined in the first pass or unspecified in the assembly language.
Possible values are
.Li 1 , 2 ,
or
.Li 4 .
The default is
.Cx Fl d
.Li 4
.Cx ,
.Cx
if
.Fl d
is not given.
.Tp Fl L
Save defined labels beginning with a
\*(LqL\*(Rq, which are normally discarded
to save space in the resultant symbol table.
The compilers generate such temporary labels.
.Tp Fl V
Use virtual memory for some intermediate storage,
rather than a temporary file.
.Tp Fl W
Do not complain about errors.
.Tp Fl J
Use long branches to resolve jumps when byte-displacement branches are
insufficient.  This must be used when a compiler-generated assembly contains
branches of more than 32k bytes.
.Tp Fl R
Make initialized data segments read-only, by concatenating them to
the text segments.
This obviates the need to run editor scripts on assembly
code to make initialized data read-only and shared.
.Tp Fl t
Specifies a directory to receive the temporary file, other than
the default /tmp.
.Tp
.Pp
Symbols remaining undefined upon completion are assumed global
.Pp
Output is either placed in
.Ar outfile,
if given, or sent
placed in
.Pa a.out .
.Sh FILES
.Dw /tmp/as*
.Di L
.Dp Pa tmp/as\(**
default temporary files
.Dp Pa a.out
default resultant object file

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm As
appeared as a PDP11
assembler in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  It has been hacked a bit
at various times to accomodate different DEC hardware, including this
VAX version.
.Sh BUGS
.Fl J
should be eliminated; the assembler should automatically choose among
byte, word and long branches.
