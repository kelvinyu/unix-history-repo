.Sh NAME
.Nm rxformat
.Nd format floppy disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rxformat
.Op Fl d
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rxformat
program formats a diskette in the specified drive
associated with the special device
.Ar special .
.Pf ( Ar Special
is normally
.Pa /dev/rx0 ,
for drive 0, or
.Pa /dev/rx1 ,
for drive 1.)
.Pp
Available option:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Force double density formatting.
By default, the diskette is formatted single density;
Single density is compatible 
with the
.Tn IBM
3740 standard (128 bytes/sector). 
In double density, each sector
contains 256 bytes of data.
.El
.Pp
Before formatting a diskette
.Nm rxformat
prompts for verification if standard input is a tty
(this allows a user to cleanly
abort the operation; note that
formatting a diskette will destroy any existing data).
Formatting is done by the hardware.
All sectors are zero-filled.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy \&No such device
means that the drive is not ready, 
usually because no disk is in the drive or the drive door is open.
Other error messages are selfexplanatory.

.Sh BUGS
A floppy may not be formatted if the
header info on sector 1, track 0 has been damaged.  Hence, it is not
possible to format a completely degaussed disk. 
(This is actually a problem in the DEC hardware.)
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
