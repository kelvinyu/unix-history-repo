cpio - format of cpio archive
.in -5
.sp
DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +5
The header structure, when the -c option of cpio(1) is not used, is:
.sp
struct {
.TS
center;
l l.
short	h_magic,
	h_dev;
ushort	h_ino,
	h_mode,
	h_uid,
	h_gid;
short	h_nlink,
	h_rdev,
	h_mtime[2],
	h_namesize,
	h_filesize[2];
char	h_name[h_namesize rounded to word];
.TE
} Hdr;
.sp
.in -5
When the -c option is used, the header information is described by:
.DS
               sscanf(Chdr,"%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%11lo%6o%11lo%s",
                      &Hdr.h_magic, &Hdr.h_dev, &Hdr.h_ino, &Hdr.h_mode,
                      &Hdr.h_uid, &Hdr.h_gid, &Hdr.h_nlink, &Hdr.h_rdev,
                      &Longtime, &Hdr.h_namesize,&Longfile,Hdr.h_name);
.DE
Longtime and Longfile are equivalent to Hdr.h_mtime and
Hdr.h_filesize, respectively.  The contents of each file are
recorded in an element of the array of varying lenght
structures, archive, together with other items describing
the file.  Every instance of h_magic contains the constant
070707 (octal).  The itmes h_dev through h_mtime have
meanings explained in stat(2).  The length of the null-
terminated path name H_name, icluding the null byte, is
given by h_namesize.
.sp
The last record of the archive always contains the name
TRAILER!!!.  Special files, directories, and the trailer are
recorded with H_filesize equal to zero.
