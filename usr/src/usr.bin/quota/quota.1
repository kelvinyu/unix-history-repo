.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quota
displays users' disk usage and limits. 
By default only the user quotas are printed.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that group quotas
for the groups of which the user is a member should be printed.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP
specifies that both the user quotas and the group quotas for
the groups of which the user is a member should be printed.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag is equivalent to the default.
.PP
Only the super-user may use the \fI-u\fP flag and the optional
.I user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the the \fI-g\fP flag and optional
.I group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.PP
If a
.B \-v
flag is supplied, 
.I quota
will also display quotas on filesystems
where no storage is allocated.
.PP
The
.B \-q
flag prints a more terse message,
containing only information
on filesystems where usage is over quota.
The \fI-q\fP flag takes precedence over the \fI-v\fP flag.
.PP
.I Quota
reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed in
.IR /etc/fstab .
If 
.I quota
exits with a non-zero status, one or more filesystems
are over quota.
.SH FILES
.DT
\fIquota.user\fP	at the filesystem root with user quotas
.br
\fIquota.group\fP	at the filesystem root with group quotas
.br
/etc/fstab	to find filesystem names and locations
