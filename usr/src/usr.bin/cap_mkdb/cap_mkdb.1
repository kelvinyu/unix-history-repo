.Sh NAME
.Nm Cap_mkdb
.Nd create capability database
.Pp
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cap_mkdb
.Op Fl f Ar outfile
.Ar file1
.Op Ar file2 ...
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Cap_mkdb 
builds a hash table database out of a 
.Xr getcap 3 
logical database constructed by the concatenation of each 
.Ar file 
specified.  
.Pp
The utility builds a hash database whose name is formed 
by the concatenation of the database basename (see
.Fl f
option)
and
.Nm .db 
which can then be used for record access.
The resulting database allows much faster access of the capability records by 
the  
.Xr getcap 3
routines than the corresponding ASCII file access routines.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent-two
.It Fl f Ar outfile
Specify database basename.  Default is
.Ar file1 .
.Pp
.Sh EXIT VALUES
.Nm Cap_mkdb 
exits with status 0 on success and 1 on failure.
.Pp
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa ./file1.db
Default database name.
.It Pa ./outfile.db
Created with 
.Fl f 
option.
