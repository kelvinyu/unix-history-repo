.SH DESCRIPTION
\fILock\fP requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
and then it will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated.  There are three other conditions under which it will terminate: it
accepts the password for root as an alternative to the one given by the
user, it will timeout after some interval of time, and it may be killed by
somebody with the appropriate permission. The default time limit is 15 minutes
but it may be changed with the \fI-t\fP option where \fItimeout\fP is the
time limit in minutes.  The \fI-p\fP option has \fIlock\fP use the user's
standard password instead of requesting another one.
