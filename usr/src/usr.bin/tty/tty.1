.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tty
.Op Fl s
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tty
utility writes the name of the terminal attached to standard input
to standard output.
The name that is written is the string returned by
.Xr ttyname 3 .
If the standard input is not a terminal, the message ``not a tty''
is written.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Don't write the terminal name; only the exit status is affected
when this option is specified.
The
.Fl s
option is deprecated in favor of the
.Dq Li "test -t 0"
command.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Tty
exits 0 if the standard input is a terminal, 1 if the standard input is
not a terminal, and >1 if an error occurs.
