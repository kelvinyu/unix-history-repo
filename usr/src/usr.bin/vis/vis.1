.SH NAME
vis \- display non-printable characters in a visual format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vis
[
.B \-nwcgoifsh
] [
.B \-F
foldwidth
] [ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIVis\fP is a filter for converting non-printable characters
into a visual representation.  It differs from cat -v in that
the form is unique and invertible.  A detailed description of the
various visual formats is given in cencode(3).
.SH OPTIONS
The c, g, and o flags select a particular display format.  All
three can be requested independent of each other, since two
of them only operate on a subset of the non-printable characters.
.IP -c
Request a format which displays a small subset of the
non-printable characters using C-style backslash sequences.
.IP -g
Request a format which displays non-printable characters
using a \\^C notation for control characters, and \\M notation
for meta characters (chars with the 8th bit set).  All non-printables,
except space and meta-space when using the \-w flag, can be encoded 
using this format.
.IP -o
Request a format which displays non-printable characters as
an octal number, \\ddd.  All non-printable characters can
be displayed using this format.
.IP -w
Normally
.B vis
considers white space (space-tab-newline) as printable.  The -w
flag causes white space to be encoded in a visual form.
.IP -i
Causes
.B vis
to invert visually encoded data back to its original form.  When
using -i, it is unnecessary to select an encoding format, since
all formats are unique and invertible.
.IP -f
and
.IP -F
Causes
.B vis
to fold output lines to foldwidth columns (default 80), like fold(1), except
that a hidden newline sequence is used, which is removed
when inverting the file back to its original form with -i.
If the last character in the encoded file does not end in a newline,
.B vis
automatically appends a hidden newline to the end.  This makes
various editors and other utilities happy.
.IP -s
Causes vis to strip the 8th bit on all characters.  This obviously
produces non-invertible output.
.IP -n
Normally, if none of -c, -g, or -o are selected, vis turns on
all three flags.  The -n flag forces vis to disable any encoding,
except for backslash stuffing and line length folding.
.IP -h
When using -i to invert data, this causes
.B vis
to treat the hat (^) as a special character all the time (normally, all
visual sequences are preceded by a backslash).  This option
is provided for compatibility with the common convention that ^C
introduces a control character sequence; however, the new invertible
sequence, \\^C, is recommended as the preferred representation.
