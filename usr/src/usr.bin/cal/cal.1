The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred on 3 September
1752.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although
a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)
From 3 September 1752 through 13 September 1752 was eliminated by
the reformation, so the calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
