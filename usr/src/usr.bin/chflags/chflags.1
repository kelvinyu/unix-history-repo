.Sh NAME
.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chflags
.Op Fl HRh
.Ar flags
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm chflags
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.  All other
symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not followed.
.It Fl R
Traverse a file hierarchy.
For each file that is of type directory,
.Nm chflags
changes the flags of all files in the file hierarchy below it followed
by the flags of the directory itself.
.It Fl h
When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, follow it.
.El
.Pp
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
.\"arch	nothing yet.
dump	set the dump flag
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
.Ed
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
nodump	the file should never be dumped
.Ed
.Pp
The flags of a symbolic link are immutable, so that unless the
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
flags are set,
.Nm chflags
on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.
.Pp
The
.Nm chflags
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
