options:

	O_SUN		use 68000 byte ordering
	O_4_1C		4.1c
	O_4_1A		4.1a

	4.2bsd on a vax needs no flags.

	Some systems will need the jobs library.

	4.1a does not support the 't' command.

The makefile can be updated with mkmf.

Do not profile on 4.1.  A bug in the system causes profiling
to stay on after an exec.
