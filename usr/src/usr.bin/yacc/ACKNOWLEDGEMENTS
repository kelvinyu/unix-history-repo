     Berkeley Yacc owes much to the unflagging efforts of Keith Bostic.
His badgering kept me working on it long after I was ready to quit.

     Berkeley Yacc owes much of its speed to Tom Pennello and Frank DeRemer.
Their excellent algorithm for computing LALR(1) lookaheads, described in their
almost impenetrable article in TOPLAS 4,4, lies at the core of Berkeley Yacc.

     Finally, much of the credit for the latest version must go to those
who pointed out deficiencies of my earlier releases.  Among the more
prolific contributors were

	  Benson I. Margulies
	  Dale Smith
	  Ozan Yigit
	  Dave Gentzel
	  John Campbell
	  Bill Sommerfeld
	  Paul Hilfinger
	  Gary Bridgewater
	  Dave Bakken
	  Dan Lanciani
	  Richard Sargent
	  Parag Patel
