Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc has been made
as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley Yacc can accept any
input specification that conforms to the AT&T Yacc documentation.
Specifications that take advantage of undocumented features of AT&T Yacc
will probably be rejected.

The data structures and algorithms used in Berkeley Yacc are all either
taken from documents available to the general public or are inventions of
the author.
