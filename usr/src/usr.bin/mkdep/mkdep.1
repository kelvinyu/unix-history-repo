.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdep
.Nd construct Makefile dependency list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkdep
.Op Fl ap
.Op Fl f Ar depend_file
.Op Ar flags
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mkdep
takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list
of C source files as arguments and constructs a set of include
file dependencies which are written into the file
.Ar depend_file  ,
or
.Pa \&.depend
by default.  An example of its use in a Makefile
might be:
.Pp
.Ds I
CFLAGS= -O -DDEBUG -I../include -I.
SRCS= file1.c file2.c

depend:
	mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}
.De
.Pp
where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro
CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.
.Pp
Options:
.Tw Ds
.Tp Fl p
.Nm mkdep
produces dependencies of the form
.Dq Li program: program.c
so that subsequent makes will produce
.Ar program
directly from its C module rather than using an intermediate
.Pa \&.o
module.  This is useful in directories that
contain many programs, each of whose source is contained in a single
C module.
.Tp Fl a
Append to the output file,
so that multiple
.Sf Nm mkdep \&'s
may be run from a single Makefile.
