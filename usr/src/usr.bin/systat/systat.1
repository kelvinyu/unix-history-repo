.SH NAME
systat \- display system statistics on a crt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B systat
[
.RI \- display
] [
refresh-interval
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Systat
displays various system statistics in a screen oriented fashion
using the curses screen display library, 
.IR curses (3X).
.PP
While
.I systat
is running the screen is usually divided into two windows (an exception
is the vmstat display which uses the entire screen).  The
upper window depicts the current system load average.  The
information displayed in the lower window may vary, depending on
user commands.  The last line on the screen is reserved for user
input and error messages.
.PP
By default
.I systat
displays the processes getting the largest percentage of the processor
in the lower window.  Other displays show swap space usage, disk i/o
statistics (a la
.IR iostat (1)),
virtual memory statistics (a la
.IR vmstat (1)),
network ``mbuf'' utilization, and network connections (a la
.IR netstat (1)).
.PP
Input is interpreted at two different levels. 
A ``global'' command interpreter processes all keyboard input.
If this command interpreter fails to recognize a command, the
input line is passed to a per-display command interpreter.  This
allows each display to have certain display-specific commands.
.PP
Certain characters cause immediate action by 
.IR systat .
These are
.IP ^L
Refresh the screen.
.IP ^G
Print the name of the current ``display'' being shown in
the lower window and the refresh interval.
.IP ^Z
Stop 
.IR systat .
.IP :
Move the cursor to the command line and interpret the input
line typed as a command.  While entering a command the
current character erase, word erase, and line kill characters
may be used.
.PP
The following commands are interpreted by the ``global''
command interpreter.
.IP help
.br
Print the names of the available displays on the command line.
.IP load
.br
Print the load average over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes
on the command line.
.IP stop
.br
Stop refreshing the screen.
.IP "[ start ] [ number ]"
.br
Start (continue) refreshing the screen.  If a second, numeric,
argument is provided it is interpreted as a refresh interval
(in seconds).
Supplying only a number will set the refresh interval to this
value.
.IP "quit"
.br
Exit 
.IR systat .
(This may be abbreviated to
.IR q ).
.PP
The available displays are:
.IP pigs
.br
Display, in the lower window, those processes resident in main
memory and getting the
largest portion of the processor (the default display). 
When less than 100% of the
processor is scheduled to user processes, the remaining time
is accounted to the ``idle'' process.
.IP iostat
.br
Display, in the lower window, statistics about processor use
and disk throughput.  Statistics on processor use appear as
bar graphs of the amount of time executing in user mode (``user''),
in user mode running low priority processes (``nice''), in 
system mode (``system''), and idle (``idle'').  Statistics
on disk throughput show, for each drive, kilobytes of data transferred,
number disk transaction performed, and average seek time
(in milliseconds).  This information may be displayed as
bar graphs or as rows of numbers which scroll downward.  Bar
graphs are shown by default; commands specific to this display  
are discussed below.
.IP swap
.br
Display, in the lower window, swap space in use on each swap
device configured.  Two sets of bar graphs are shown.  The
upper graph displays swap space allocated to pure text segments
(code), the lower graph displays space allocated to stack and
data segments.  Allocated space is sorted by its size into buckets
of size dmmin, dmmin*2, dmmin*4, up to dmmax (to reflect allocation
policies imposed by the system).  The disk segment size, in sectors,
is displayed along the left hand side of the text,
and data and stack graphs.
Space allocated to the user structure and page
tables is not currently accounted for.
.IP mbufs
.br
Display, in the lower window, the number of mbufs allocated
for particular uses, i.e. data, socket structures, etc.
.IP vmstat
.br
Take over the entire display and show a (rather crowded) compendium
of statistics related to virtual memory usage, process scheduling,
device interrupts, system name translation cacheing, disk i/o, etc.
.IP netstat
.br
Display, in the lower window, network connections.  By default,
network servers awaiting requests are not displayed.  Each address
is displayed in the format ``host.port'', with each shown symbolically,
when possible.  It is possible to have addresses displayed numerically,
limit the display to a set of ports, hosts, and/or protocols; see the
list commands below.
.PP
Commands to switch between displays may be abbreviated to the
minimum unambiguous prefix; for example, ``io'' for ``iostat''.
Certain information may be discarded when the screen size is
insufficient for display.  For example, on a machine with 10
drives the 
.I iostat
bar graph displays only 3 drives on a 24 line terminal.  When
a bar graph would overflow the allotted screen space it is
truncated and the actual value is printed ``over top'' of the bar.
.PP
The following commands are specific to the 
.I iostat
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.IP numbers
Show the disk i/o statistics in numeric form.  Values are
displayed in numeric columns which scroll downward.
.IP bars
Show the disk i/o statistics in bar graph form (default).
.IP msps
Toggle the display of average seek time (the default is to
not display seek times).
.IP "ignore [ drives ]"
Do not display information about the drives indicated.  Multiple
drives may be specified, separated by spaces.
.IP "display [ drives ]"
Display information about the drives indicated.  Multiple drives
may be specified, separated by spaces.
.PP
The following commands are specific to the
.I vmstat
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.IP boot
Display cummulative statistics since the system was booted.
.IP run
Display statistics as a running total from the point this
command is given.
.IP time
Display statistics averaged over the refresh interval (the default).
.IP zero
Reset running statistics to zero.
.PP
The following commands are specific to the
.I netstat
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.IP all
Toggle the displaying of server processes awaiting requests (this
is the equivalent of the 
.B \-a
flag to
.IR netstat (1)).
.IP numbers
Display network addresses numerically.
.IP names
Display network addresses symbolically.
.IP "port name"
Limit the display to connections on the specified port (the port
is matched against the port both on the local and the foreign side
of a connection).  A port
.I name
may be specified symbolically, e.g. ``ftp'', or numerically (base 10).
This command may be specified many times to create a set of ports
for matching.
.IP "host name"
Limit the display to connections to or from the specified host.  A
host
.I name
may be specified symbolically or numerically in the Internet dot
notation.  This command may be specified many times to create a set
of hosts for matching.
.IP "protocol name"
Limit the display to connections using the specified protocol (currently
``tcp'' or ``udp'').  The commands
.I tcp
and
.I udp
are shorthands for ``protocol tcp'' and ``protocol udp'', respectively.
.IP "reset"
Reset the port, host, and protocol matching mechanisms to the default
(any protocol, port, or host).

.SH BUGS
Takes 2-10 percent of the cpu.  Certain displays presume
a 24 line by 80 character terminal.  The swap space display
should account for space allocated to the user structure and
page tables.   The
.I vmstat
display looks out of place because it is (it was added in as
a separate display rather than create a new program). 
.PP
The whole
thing is pretty hoakey, it was included in the distribution under
serious duress.
