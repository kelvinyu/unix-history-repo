] file1 file2; or file1 ... fileN directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the \fB-c\fP option is specified)
to the target file or directory.  If the destination is a directory, then
the \fIfile\fP is moved into \fIdirectory\fP with its original file-name.
If the target file already exists, it is overwritten.
.PP
The mode is set to 755; the \fB-m\fP option may be used to specify
an alternate mode.
.PP
The \fB-o\fP and \fB-g\fP options may be used to specify an alternate
owner and/or group, respectively.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option causes the file to be stripped.  It is an error
to attempt to strip a file not in the \fIa.out\fP format, but not to
attempt to strip a file that has already been stripped.
.PP
\fIInstall\fP refuses to move a file onto itself.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of 1 is returned.
