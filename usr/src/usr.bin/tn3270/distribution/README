Welcome to the new tn3270.

Unfortunately, things are much more complicated that ever.  There are now
subdirectories.

The good news is that MOST system dependent code is in a few subdirectories
(mostly in sys_curses, on Unix, or sys_dos, on MS_DOS).

On MS_DOS, the INCLUDE environmental variable is assumed to point to
the standard include files, plus to whereever the networking include
files are located.  These are files like <sys/socket.h>.  This is
assuming that you have a 4.2/3 network emulation package (UB offers such
a package with their product; my understanding is that FTP Software
is, or soon will be, offering such a package).
