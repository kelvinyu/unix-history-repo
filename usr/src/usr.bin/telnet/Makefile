# The following is the telnet makefile.  The sources are down one level
# in directory "Source" because the sources are shared between telnet
# and tn3270.

VPATH	=	Source
INCLUDES=	-ISource

#
# TERMCAP	Define this if your system is termcap based,
#		otherwise a terminfo based system is assumed.
#
# SRCRT		Includes code to allow you to specify source routes.
#		Format is:
#			[!]@hop1@hop2...[@|:]dst
#		Leading ! means strict source route.
#
# USE_TERMIO	Define this if you have System V termio structures.
#		What is here is how things are on Cray computers.
#
# KLUDGELINEMODE Define this to get the kludged up version of linemode
#		that was in 4.3BSD.  This is a good thing to have
#		around for talking to older systems.
#
# NOSTRNCASECMP	Define this if you do not have strncasecmp() in
#		your C libarary.
#
# strrchr=rindex Define this if you do not have strrchr() in your
#		C libaray (but you do have rindex...)
#
