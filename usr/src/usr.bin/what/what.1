.SH NAME
what \- show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B what
name ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I What
reads each file and searches for sequences of the form ``@(#)''
as inserted by the source code control system.  It then prints the remainder
of the string after this marker, up to a null character, newline, double
quote, or ``>'' character.
.SH BUGS
As SCCS is not licensed with UNIX/32V, this is a rewrite of the
.I what
command which is part of SCCS, and may not behave exactly the same as that
command does.
