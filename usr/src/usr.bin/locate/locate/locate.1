.Sh NAME
.Nm locate
.Nd find files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar locate
pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Locate
searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified
.Ar pattern  .
The database is recomputed periodically, and contains the pathnames
of all files which are publicly accessible.
.Pp
Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\e'', ``[''
and ``]'')
may be used in
.Ar pattern  ,
although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
Preceding any character with a backslash (``\e'') eliminates any special
meaning which it may have.
The matching differs in that no characters must be matched explicitly,
including slashes (``/'').
.Pp
As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.
