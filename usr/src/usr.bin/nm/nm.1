.SH NAME
nm \- print name list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nm
[
.B \-agnopruw
]
[ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nm
prints the name list (symbol table) of each object
.I file
in the argument list.
If an argument is an archive, a listing for each object file in the
archive will be produced.
If no
.I file
is given, the symbols in ``a.out'' are listed.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B  \-a
Print symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.
.TP
.B  \-g
Print only global (external) symbols.
.TP
.B \-n
Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.
.TP
.B  \-o
Prepend file or archive element name to each output line rather than only once.
.TP
.B  \-p
Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.
.TP
.B  \-r
Sort in reverse order.
.TP
.B  \-u
Print only undefined symbols.
.TP
.B  \-w
Warn about non-object archive members.
Normally, nm will silently ignore all archive members which are not
object files.
.PP
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol
is undefined) and one of the following letters:
.TP
.B \-
debugger symbol table entries (see the
.B \-a
option).
.TP
.B A
absolute

.TP
.B f

.TP
.B T

If the symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.
