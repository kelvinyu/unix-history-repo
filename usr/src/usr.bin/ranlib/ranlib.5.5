.Sh NAME
.Nm ranlib
.Nd archive (library) table-of-contents format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <ranlib.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The archive table-of-contents command
.Nm ranlib
creates a table of contents for archives, containing object files, to
be used by the link-editor
.Xr ld 1 .
It operates on archives created with the utility
.Xr ar 1 .
.Pp
The
.Nm Ranlib
function
prepends a new file to the archive which has three separate parts.
The first part is a standard archive header, which has a special name
field,  "__.SYMDEF".
.Pp
The second part is a ``long'' followed by a list of ranlib structures.
The long is the size, in bytes, of the list of ranlib structures.
Each of the ranlib structures consists of a zero based offset into the
next section (a string table of symbols) and an offset from the beginning
of the archive to the start of the archive file which defines the symbol.
The actual number of ranlib structures is this number divided by the size
of an individual ranlib structure.
.Pp
The third part is a ``long'' followed by a string table.
The long is the size, in bytes of the string table.
