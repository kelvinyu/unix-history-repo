.Sh NAME
.Nm ranlib
.Nd convert archives to random libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ranlib
.Op Fl t
.Ar archive ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ranlib
converts each
.Ar archive
to a form which the loader can load more rapidly.
.Nm Ranlib
does this by adding a table of contents called
.Sy \&__.SYMDEF
to the beginning of the archive.
.Nm Ranlib
uses
.Xr ar  1
to reconstruct the archive, so that sufficient temporary file space must
be available in the file system which contains the current directory.
.Pp
.Tp Fl t
Ranlib only "touches" the archives and does not modify them.
This is useful after copying an archive
or using the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr make  1
in order to avoid having
.Xr ld  1
complain about
an
.Dq out of date
symbol table.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ld 1 ,
.Xr ar 1 ,
.Xr lorder 1 ,
.Xr make 1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Ranlib
appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
.Sh BUGS
Because generation of a library by
.Xr ar
and randomization of the library by
.Nm ranlib
are separate processes, phase errors are possible.  The loader,
.Xr ld  ,
warns when the modification date of a library is more recent than the
creation date of its dictionary;  but this means that you get the
warning even if you only copy the library.
