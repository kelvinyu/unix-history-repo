.SH NAME
calendar \- reminder service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calendar
[ \-a ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Calendar 
reads the file ``calendar'' in the current directory and displays lines
that begin with either today's or tomorrow's date.
On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP
\-a
Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
to them.
This requires super-user privileges.
.PP
A month and day should begin lines.
They may be entered in almost any format, either numeric or as character
strings.
A single asterisk (``*'') matches every month.
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
A month without a day matches the first of that month.
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading whitespace default to the last entered date, allowing
multiple line specifications for a single date.
By convention, dates followed by an asterisk are not fixed, i.e. change
from year to year.
.PP
The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by
.IR cpp (1),
allowing the inclusion of shared files such as company holidays or
meetings.
If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname,
.I cpp
searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the
directory
.IR /usr/share/calendar .
Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */)
are ignored.
.PP
Some possible calendar entries:
.in +5
.sp
.nf
#include	<calendar.usholiday>
#include	<calendar.birthday>
.sp
