.SH NAME
printenv \- print out the environment
.br
env \- set and print out the environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B printenv
[name]
.br
.B env
[-] [name=value ...] [command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Printenv
prints out the names and values of the variables in the environment,
with one name/value pair per line.  If \fIname\fP is specified, only
its value is printed.
.PP
If a
.I name
is specified and it is not defined in the environment,
.I printenv
returns exit status 1, else it returns status 0.
.PP
\fIEnv\fP executes \fIcommand\fP after modifying the environment as
specified on the command line.  The option \fIname=value\fP specifies
an environmental variable, \fIname\fP, with a value of \fIvalue\fP.
The option \fI-\fP causes \fIenv\fP to completely ignore the environment
it inherits.
.PP
If no command is specified, \fIenv\fP prints out the names and values
of the variables in the environment, with one name/value pair per line.
.SH SEE ALSO
csh(1), sh(1), execvp(3), environ(7)
.SH BUGS
\fIEnv\fP doesn't handle commands with equal (``='') signs in their
names, for obvious reasons.
