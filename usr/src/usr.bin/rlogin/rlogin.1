.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rlogin
connects your terminal on the current local host system
.I lhost
to the remote host system
.I rhost.
.PP
The version built to use the Kerberos authentication from
MIT Project Athena first attempts
to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism, described below.
If this fails, the standard Berkeley \fIrhosts\fP mechanism is used
for authorization to use a remote account.
.PP
Each user may have a private authorization list in a file \&.klogin
in his login directory.  Each line in this file should contain a
Kerberos principal name of the form 
.IR principal.instance@realm .
If the originating user is authenticated to one of the principals named
in \&.klogin, access is granted to the account.  The principal
\fIaccountname\fP.@\fIlocalrealm\fP is granted access if there is no
\&.klogin file. 
Otherwise
a login and password will be prompted for on the remote machine as in
.IR login (1).
To avoid some security problems, the \&.klogin file must be owned by
the remote user.
.PP
If Kerberos authentication fails,
an error message is printed and the standard UCB rlogin is
used instead.
.PP
A line of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host, where
``~'' is the escape character.
Similarly, the line ``~^Z'' (where ^Z, control-Z, is the suspend character)
will suspend the rlogin session.
Substitution of the delayed-suspend character (normally ^Y)
for the suspend character suspends the send portion of the rlogin,
but allows output from the remote system.
.PP
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for
delays) the rlogin is transparent.  Flow control via ^S and ^Q and
flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled properly.
.PP
The
.B \-8
option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's
stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q. Eight-bit mode is the default.
.PP
The
.B \-L
option allows the rlogin session to be run in litout mode.
.PP
The
.B \-e
option allows specification of a different escape character.
There is no space separating this option flag and the new escape
character.
.PP
The
.B \-7
option forces seven-bit transmissions.
.PP
The
.B \-d
option turns on socket debugging (see \fIsetsockopt(2)\fR) on the TCP
sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.PP
The
.B \-k
option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
.I realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by 
.IR krb_realmofhost (3).
.PP
The
.B \-x
option turns on DES encryption for all data passed via the
rlogin session.
This may reduces response time and increases CPU utilization while
providing increased security.
