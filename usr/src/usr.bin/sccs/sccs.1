.TH SCCS 1
.SH NAME
sccs \- front end for the
.SM SCCS
subsystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sccs
[
.B \-r
] [
.BI \-p path
] command [ flags ] [ args ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sccs
is a front end
to the
.SM SCCS
programs
that help them mesh more cleanly
with the rest of UNIX.
It also includes the capability to run
``set user id'' to another user
to provide additional protection.
.PP
Basically,
.I sccs
runs the
.I command
with the specified
.I flags
and
.I args.
Each
argument
is modified to be prepended
with ``SCCS/s.''
unless it begins with ``s.'',
contains a `\|/\|' character,
or specifies a directory.
.PP
Flags to be interpreted by the
.I sccs
program must be before the
.I command
argument.
Flags to be passed to the actual
.SM SCCS
program
must come after the
.I command
argument.
These flags are specific to the command
and are discussed in the documentation for that command.
.PP
Besides the usual
.SM SCCS
commands,
several ``pseudo-commands'' can be issued.
These are:
.IP edit 1i
Equivalent to ``get \-e''.
.IP delget
Perform a delta on the named files
and then get new versions.
The new versions will have id keywords expanded,
and will not be editable.
.IP deledit
Equivalent to ``delget'' except that the
``get'' phase includes the ``\-e'' flag.
This option is useful for making a ``checkpoint''
of your current editting phase.
.IP fix
Must be followed by a
.B \-r
flag.
This command essentially removes the named delta,
but leaves you with a copy of the delta
with the changes that were in it.
It is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, etc.
Since it doesn't leave audit trails,
it should be used carefully.
.IP clean
Takes no arguments.
This routine removes everything from the current directory
that can be recreated from SCCS files.
It will not remove any files being editted.
.IP unedit
This is the opposite of an ``edit''
or a ``get \-e''.
It should be used with extreme caution,
since any changes you made since the get
will be irretrievably lost.
.IP info
Gives a listing of all files being editted.
.PP
The
.B \-r
flag runs
.I sccs
as the real user
rather than as whatever effective user
.I sccs
is ``set user id'' to.
The
.B \-p
flag defines the pathname of the directory
in which
.SM SCCS
will be found;
``SCCS'' is the default.
.PP
Certain commands (such as
.IR admin )
cannot be run ``set user id'' by all users,
since this would allow anyone to change the authorizations.
These commands are always run as the real user.
.SH EXAMPLES
.de BX
.nf
.in +0.5i
.sp 0.3
..
.de EX
.fi
.in -0.5i
.sp 0.3
..
To get a file for editting,
edit it,
and produce a new delta:
.BX
sccs get \-e file.c
ex file.c
sccs delta file.c
.EX
To get a file from another directory:
.BX
sccs \-p/usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c
.EX
or
.BX
sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c
.EX
To make a delta of a large number of files
in the current directory:
.BX
sccs delta *.c
.EX
In a makefile, to get source files
from an
.SM SCCS
file if it does not already exist:
.BX
SRCS = <list of source files>
OBJS = <list of object files>
.sp 0.4
$(OBJS): $(SRCS)
.sp 0.4
$(SRCS):
	sccs get $(REL) $@
.EX
