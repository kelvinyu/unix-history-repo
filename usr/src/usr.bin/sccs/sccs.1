.SH NAME
sccs \- front end for the
.SM SCCS
subsystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sccs
[
.B \-r
] [
.BI \-p path
] command [ flags ] [ args ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sccs
is a front end
to csvax:eric.
that make them mesh more cleanly
with the rest of UNIX.
It also runs as a special user
.B sccs
so that the
.SM SCCS
file protection
can be used to advantage.
.PP
Basically,
.I sccs
runs the
.I command
with the specified
.I flags
and
.I args.
Each
argument
is modified to be prepended
with ``SCCS/s.''
unless it begins with ``s.'',
contains a `\|/\|' character,
or specifies a directory.
.PP
Flags to be interpreted by the
.I sccs
program must be before the
.I command
argument.
Flags to be passed to the actual
.SM SCCS
program
must come after the
.I command
argument.
These flags are specific to the command
and are discussed in the documentation for that command.
.PP
The
.B \-r
flag runs
.I sccs
as the real user
rather than as the pseudo-user
.B sccs.
The
.B \-p
flag defines the path to prepend to
.SM SCCS
file names;
``SCCS/s.'' is the default.

To get a file for editting,
edit it,
and produce a new delta:
.BX
% sccs get \-e file.c
% ex file.c
% sccs delta file.c
.EX
To get a file from another directory:
.BX
% sccs \-p/usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c
.EX
or
.BX
% sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c
.EX
To make a delta of a large number of files
in the current directory:
.BX
% sccs delta *.c
.EX
In a makefile, to get source files
from an
.SM SCCS
file if it does not already exist:
.BX
SRCS = <list of source files>
OBJS = <list of object files>
