.Op Ar file

the login name,
tty name, the date and time of login, and hostname if not local.
.Pp

.It Ar \&am I
Returns the invoker's real user name. 
.It Ar file
By default,
.Nm who
gathers information from the file
.Pa /var/run/utmp .
An alternate
.Ar file
may be specified which is usually
.Pa /var/run/wtmp
(or
.Pa /var/run/wtmp.[0-6]
depending on site policy as
.Pa wtmp
can grow quite large and daily versions may or may not
kept around after compression by
.Xr ac 8 ) .
The
.Pa wtmp
file contains a record of every login, logout,
crash, shutdown and date change
since
.Pa wtmp
was last truncated or
created.
.El
.Pp
If
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
or one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce
an output line without any user name.  For more information on the
special characters, see
.Xr utmp 5 .
