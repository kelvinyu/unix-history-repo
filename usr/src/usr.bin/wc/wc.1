.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wc
counts lines, words and characters,
and optionally pages and the print time,
in the named files,
or in the standard input if no name appears.
A word is a maximal string of characters
delimited by spaces, tabs or newlines.
.PP
If an argument beginning with one of ``lwcpt'' is present,
the specified counts (lines, words, characters, pages, or time)
are selected by the letters
.BR l ,
.BR w ,
.BR c ,
.BR p ,
or
.BR t .
The default is
.B \-lwc
unless
.B \-v
is specified.
.PP
The
.B \-b
option asks that the time be figured at
the specified baud rate instead of the default 300 baud.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option specifies that pages are
.I pagesize
lines long instead of the default 66.
.PP
The
.B \-u
options asks that the time printed be based on uucp
transmission time, about 90% as fast as normal.
.PP
The
.B \-v
option asks for a verbose output format,
with headers and including pages and time by default.
.SH BUGS
The times given do not take into account variable factors
such as system load;
delays due to tab expansion or tty driver delays,
which can be a factor with cu;
or uucp delays such as mail headers, auxillary protocol files, 
or the time taken to initially connect to another site.
