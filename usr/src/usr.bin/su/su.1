.SH NAME
su \- substitute user id
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B su
[-fl] [login]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Su
requests the password for
.I login
(or for ``root'', if no login is provided), changes to that user and
group ID and invokes another instance of your login shell.
The environment is unmodified.
.PP
If the invoked shell is
.IR csh ,
the
.I -f
option prevents it from reading your
.I .cshrc
file.  Otherwise, the
.I -f
option is ignored.
.PP
The
.I -l
option simulates a full login; the environment is discarded except for
HOME, SHELL, TERM, and USER.  HOME, SHELL, and USER are taken from the
password file for the user being substituted.  TERM is copied from
your environment.  The invoked shell is the substituted user's, not
yours.
.PP
The new user ID stays in force until the shell exits.
.PP
If the substituted user has no password, their login shell is invoked
rather than yours.
.PP
Only users in group 0 (normally ``wheel'') can
.I su
to ``root'', even with the root password.
.PP
To remind the super-user of his responsibilities, by default,
the shell substitutes ``#'' for its usual prompt.
