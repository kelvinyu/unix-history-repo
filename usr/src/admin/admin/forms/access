	Agreement for Access to Proprietary UNIX Software


I understand that I am being given access to Western Electric Company's
proprietary UNIX software to assist with the development of, and for
the review of, Berkeley UNIX.  I have been notified that any disclosure
to me of this software is made in confidence and that I am obligated to
keep it in confidence.  I understand that this obligation shall survive
and continue after my access terminates, but that this obligation shall
not extend to any information or technical data which is now available
to the general public or which becomes available to the general public
by acts not attributable to the University of California, its employees,
or students.

I understand that any accounts on source machines at Berkeley that are
made available to me are to be used only to assist in the development of,
and for the review of, Berkeley UNIX.  I will not copy any source or
documentation from a Berkeley machine to any other machine without the
explicit written or electronic approval of a CSRG staff member.  I will
not make any source or documentation from Berkeley UNIX available to
anyone else without the explicit written or electronic approval of a CSRG
staff member.
