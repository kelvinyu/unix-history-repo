	Agreement for Access to Proprietary UNIX Software


I understand that I am being given access to Western Electric Company's
proprietary UNIX software to assist with the development of, and for
the review of, Berkeley UNIX.  I have been notified that any disclosure
to me of this software is made in confidence and that I am obligated to
keep it in confidence.  I understand that this obligation shall survive
and continue after my access terminates, but that this obligation shall
not extend to any information or technical data which is now available
to the general public or which becomes available to the general public
by acts not attributable to the University of California, its employees,
or students.
