Dear Dr. Goldstein,
.PP
We have prepared a test distribution of our current system
called 4.3BSD-Reno that we are distributing to all our test sites.
This is the distribution that we promised to make available
for use in OSF-1 in our agreement with you.
Please let me know to whom we should send the tape so that
I can ensure that OSF's copy gets sent as soon as possible.
