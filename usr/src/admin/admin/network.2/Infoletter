Dear Colleague:
.sp
.PP
We are happy to send you information about our April,
1991 update to our 1988 networking release.
This software is copyright Berkeley and may be freely redistributed.
It is available to anyone and requires no previous license, either from
AT&T or The Regents of the University of California.
.PP
This packet is designed to serve two purposes.
The first is to acquaint you with the details of our distribution
so you can decide whether you would like to purchase it.
The second purpose is to tell you how to obtain our distribution.
.SH
Distribution contents
.PP
The distribution is a source distribution only, and does
.B not
contain binaries for any architecture.
qIt includes source code and manual pages for the C library
and approximately three-fourths of the utilities distributed as
part of 4.3BSD-Reno.
An approximate list of the included and excluded utilities is provided
in the attached appendix.
.PP
Additionally, the distribution includes source code for most of the
4.3BSD-Reno kernel, including machine support for the HP300
(Motorola 68000 based machines)
and for the PC's built by Compaq and others
(Intel 386/486 based machines).
It does
.B not
include machine support for the Tahoe and VAX architectures
found in the standard BSD distributions.
The kernel source code is
.B not
complete for any architecture.
Specifically, code for executing files, doing physical I/O,
managing the buffer cache, handling process tracing and doing accounting
is not included as it contains AT&T proprietary code.
.PP
This distribution represents an intermediate point in the development
of 4.4BSD; several new facilities have been completed and are ready
for external use, while other new facilities slated for the 4.4BSD
release have not yet been integrated.
The major addition since the 4.3BSD-Reno release is the replacement 
of the 1979 vintage virtual memory system with a virtual memory
implementation derived from Carnegie-Mellon's MACH operating system.
Other major kernel changes include the elimination of all references
to the user area except for the per-process runtime stack and converting
to ANSI C (including function prototypes).
.SH
Intended audience for this distribution
.PP
This distribution is
.B not
intended to be used on production systems;
nor is it intended for sites without sufficient expertise
to find and fix problems that are encountered.
It is
.B not
suitable for the home hobbyist wishing to run BSD on their PC.
It is intended to be used to provide an advance look at some of the
facilities and interfaces that we will be distributing in 4.4BSD.
Our goal in making this release available is to obtain feedback on
problems in the design or implementation of these facilities and
interfaces.
This distribution will allow adventurous sites to gain experience with the
new framework and to provide input as it evolves into 4.4BSD.
Because many of the oldest and most stable parts of the
system have been replaced to eliminate code proprietary to AT&T,
this software is not as stable, reliable or well documented as
traditional BSD distributions.
Much of the work to be done between now and the 4.4BSD distribution
is release engineering and documentation.
.PP
Only limited support will be provided by our group.
Specifically,
we cannot provide help with installation
of this software on other systems.
We are, or course, interested in getting feedback on the problems that you
find and also any compatibility problems that you expect in trying
to convert your applications to run on this release.
Some of the interfaces in this release will change before the release
of 4.4BSD (at least in part based on feedback from this test group).
Therefore, you should not depend on applications ported to this release
working unchanged on 4.4BSD.
We appreciate your help in this debugging effort and look
forward to hearing from you.
Please send your comments to reno43-bugs@vangogh.Berkeley.EDU.
.PP
The code in this distribution may be redistributed and used
in released products.
However, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade any code
that you use from this distribution to the similarly licensed
distribution of the 4.4BSD code within one year of its release.
We regret that changes documents are not available;
the major changes are outlined in the next section.
.SH
Summary of changes since the first networking distribution
.PP
In addition to the inclusion of the process scheduling and management funtions,
there are four major new kernel facilities available in this release.
They are ISO/OSI networking support,
a freely redistributable implementation of UFS and NFS,
a new virtual memory implementation, and
the conversion to and addition of the POSIX.1 facilities.
There are numerous other changes throughout the system.
.PP
The ISO/OSI Networking consists of a kernel implementation of
transport class 4 (TP-4),
connectionless networking protocol (CLNP),
and 802.3-based link-level support (hardware-compatible with Ethernet\(dg).
.FS
\(dgEthernet is a trademark of the Xerox Corporation.
.FE
The session and presentation layers will be provided outside
the kernel by the ISO development environment (ISODE).
Included in this development environment are file
transfer and management (FTAM), virtual terminals (VT),
a directory services implementation (X.500),
and miscellaneous other utilities.
.PP
A new virtual filesystem interface has been added to the
kernel to support multiple filesystems.
Although generally similar to Sun's vnode interface,
the Berkeley interface has been structured for more efficient support
of filesystems that maintain state (such as the local filesystem).
In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'',
we have added an implementation of the network filesystem (NFS)
that fully interoperates with the NFS shipped by Sun and its licensees.
Because our NFS implementation was implemented using only the
publicly available NFS specification,
it does not require a license from Sun to use in source or binary form.
By default it runs over UDP to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
However, it can be configured on a per-mount basis to run over TCP.
Using TCP allows it to be used quickly and efficiently through
gateways and over long-haul networks.
We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory, which allows large temporary filesystems without
requiring dedicated physical memory.
.PP
The quota system has been rewritten to support both
user and group quotas (simultaneously if desired).
Quota expiration is based on time rather than
the previous metric of number of logins over quota.
This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.
.PP
The new virtual memory implementation is derived from the MACH
operating system developed at Carnegie-Mellon.
The MACH virtual memory interface has been replaced with the
``mmap''-based interface described in the ``Berkeley Software
Architecture Manual'' (see UNIX Programmer's Manual, 
Supplementary Documents, PS1:6).
The interface is similar to the interface shipped
in several commercial versions of UNIX such as SunOS 4.0.
The current integration of the new virtual memory is functionally complete,
but still has serious performance problems under heavy memory load.
The internal kernel interfaces have not yet been completed
and the memory pool and buffer cache have not yet been merged.
These changes are expected before the release of 4.4BSD.
.PP
This distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified in the POSIX.1 system interface standard.
The biggest area of change is a new terminal driver.
The terminal driver is similar to the System V terminal driver
with the addition of the necessary extensions to get the
functionality previously available in the 4.3BSD terminal driver.
This distribution also adds the POSIX job control interface,
which is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but adds a security model that was missing in the
4.3BSD job control implementation.
Other additions include POSIX signals, FIFO's, byte-range file locking,
and saved user and group identifiers.
.PP
We have been tracking the POSIX 1003.2 shell and utility work
and have included prototypes of many of the proposed utilities.
Because most of the traditional utilities have been replaced to eliminate
code proprietary to AT&T, you should realize that the utility software
not as stable, reliable or well documented as traditional Berkeley
releases.
In particular, almost the entire manual suite has been rewritten to
be freely redistributable and does not correctly reflect, in many
instances, the current software.
Most of the libraries and header files have been converted
to be compliant with ANSI C.
The compiler default is to require ANSI C;
the default can be over-ridden by using the \fB-traditional\fP flag.
Another compiler default is to put strings into the shared text region.
This change obviates the need for the xstr and mkstr utilities.
The old behavior of placing strings in data space can be obtained
by specifying the \fB-fwritable-strings\fP flag.
.PP
Work has also progressed in several other areas.
Several important enhancements have been added to the TCP/IP
protocols including TCP header prediction and
serial line IP (SLIP) with header compression.
The routing implementation has been completely rewritten
to use a hierarchical routing tree with a mask per route
to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the ISO protocols.
The routing table also stores and caches route characteristics
to speed the adaptation of the throughput and congestion avoidance
algorithms.
.PP
The Kerberos (version 4) authentication software has been
integrated into much of the system (except NFS) to provide
the first real network authentication on BSD.
.PP
The hardware supported is:
.IP \(bu
HP 9000/300 series
.IP \(bu
Intel 386/486 based PC with AT-bus peripherals
.IP \(bu
Sample drivers for the Tahoe and the VAX, but no complete machine support
.PP
The reason that this distribution is not considered an alpha release of 4.4BSD
is because it does not contain several major interfaces that we 
plan to have available for that distribution.
These include:
.IP \(bu
Support for ISO Connection-Oriented Network Service, X.25, TP-0.
.IP \(bu
A new internal network layering (``bstreams'') combining features
of the current socket layering and of Streams.
.IP \(bu
Fixes, tuning, fixes, documentation, and fixes.
.PP
This release does include several important structural kernel changes.
The kernel uses a new internal system call convention:
.ft C
.nf
.ti +5i
error = (*callp)(proc, args, retval);
.fi
.ft P
.PP
Another major change is the introduction
of a new sleep interface:
.ft C
.nf
.ti +5i
error = tsleep(wchan, pri|PCATCH, wstring, timeout);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptible sleeps.
The \fItsleep\fP interface can be used at any priority,
but is only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.
When interrupted, \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART;
all non-local goto's (longjmp's) have been eliminated from the kernel.
.PP
Many data structures that were previously statically allocated
are now allocated dynamically.
These structures include proc structure entries,
user file descriptors, the mount table,
the vnode table, the name cache, and the quota structures.
.SH
How to obtain this software
.PP
You do not have to get this software from Berkeley
nor obtain a license from Berkeley to use it.
You may obtain it from anybody that has a copy.
If you wish to obtain this software from Berkeley,
you need to follow the procedure below.
.PP
Before the distribution can be sent, we require:
.IP \(bu
Execution of the included Berkeley License Agreement.
.IP \(bu
A check from a U.S. bank for $495.00 US, payable to
``The Regents of the University of California.''
If you must issue a Purchase Order, please issue one that is blank-backed.
If this is not possible, insert and initial in the body of the Purchase
Order the following clause: ``The terms and conditions of this Purchase
Order are not accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The Berkeley License Agreement governs.''
(We are a research and development organization and not a commercial
organization; this fee covers only our distribution costs.)
.IP \(bu
The attached Site Information Form and
Checklist for Hardware/Software completely filled out and dated.
Your copy of the signed Berkeley License Agreement will be sent to the
person listed as the administrative contact.
The distribution itself will be sent to the technical contact.
All information is kept confidential;
it is for our use in notifying you of important bug fixes and
the availability of future BSD distributions.
Please note that we cannot ship to post office boxes;
therefore, please have the technical contact's
address supplied without use of a post office box.
.PP
All the above material must be sent to:
.DS
Pauline Schwartz, Distribution Coordinator

.DE
Once these three items have been received and are in proper order, the
distribution will be sent to the technical address given on the
Site Information Form.
We cannot provide delivery dates.
Once the material is assembled and packaged, the distribution is shipped
by commercial carrier.
Order of shipment will be based on time of arrival of the properly
completed paperwork.
Because of the differential in costs of shipping outside the United States,
we ask that organizations beyond the North American continent pay
the collect shipping charges.
.PP
The most expedient way to insure that your full distribution is sent as
quickly as possible is to include, in a single package, two copies of the
completed and properly signed Berkeley License Agreement (\fBwithout
