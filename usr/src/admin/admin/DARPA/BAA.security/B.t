This is a proposal for DARPA support of operating system
and networking research in the UNIX project at UC Berkeley.
The goal of the project is to use leading edge research ideas
in a stable and reliable implementation that solves current problems in
operating systems research.
The resulting system is widely used by other researchers in operating systems
and network protocols and implementations.
The network and authentication subsystems are the bases
for the TCP/IP and login authentication systems of most networked UNIX systems.
The improvements that this project will make in those subsystems will be
applicable to most research and commercial versions of UNIX.
