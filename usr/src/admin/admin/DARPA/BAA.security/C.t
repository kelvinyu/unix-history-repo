We are planning to implement prototypes for each of these
outlined areas of work over the period of this proposal.
We will do an informal release
to interested developers during the proposal period.
In particular, the informal release will be made available
to the group at Mt Xinu that is producing a commercially
supported MACH release.
After incorporating feedback and refinements from the testers,
another release will be made to interested parties
at the end of the proposal period.
