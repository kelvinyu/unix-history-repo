The security work described above has already been started informally,
and will be conducted more thoroughly at the start of the period covered
by this proposal.
We will distribute the changes to the servers electronically
as groups of servers are completed, with immediate distribution
of fixes for serious problems.
As the Internet Host Requirements are finalized,
they will be implemented and incorporated into the system.
In particular, support for IP type-of-service options and routing needs
to be added, and recent proposals for gateway monitoring should be implemented
and tested.
We will also incorporate all secuirty and Host Requirement
changes into following releases.

Once an authentication mechanism has been identified,
it will be integrated into the system and incorporated
into the final release.
