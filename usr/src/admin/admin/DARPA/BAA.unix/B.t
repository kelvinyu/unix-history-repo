This is a proposal for DARPA support of operating system
and networking research in the UNIX project at UC Berkeley.
The goal of the project is to use leading edge research ideas
in a stable and reliable implementation that solves current problems in
operating systems research.
The project also includes incorporation of network protocols and other
subsystems into the operating system while maintaining consistency
with the existing system call interface.
The resulting system is widely used by other researchers in operating systems
and network protocols and implementations.
