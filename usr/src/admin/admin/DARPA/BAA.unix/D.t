The efforts outlined above are already underway.
We expect that we will have working prototypes early in 1989.
When the prototypes are moderately stable and functional,
we will produce a test release that we will distribute to
our alpha sites for testing and feedback.
If major design flaws turn up during the alpha testing,
we will reenter the development phase to resolve the problems
resulting in another test release.
Otherwise, we will incorporate feedback from the testing
and produce a revised distribution by the end of the period
covered by this proposal.
