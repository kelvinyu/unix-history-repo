Bootstrap Procedure
.PP
This section explains the bootstrap procedure that can be used
to get the kernel supplied with this distribution running on your machine.
If you are not currently running \*(Ps you will
have to do a full bootstrap.
Chapter 3 describes how to upgrade a \*(Ps system.
An understanding of the operations used in a full bootstrap
is very helpful in performing an upgrade as well.
In either case, it is highly desirable to read and understand
the remainder of this document before proceeding.
.NH 2
Bootstrapping from the tape
.LP
The set of files on the distribution tape are as follows:
.IP 1)
dd (HP300 and DECstation) or dump (SPARC) image of the root filesystem
.IP 2)
tar image of the
.Pn /var
filesystem
.IP 3)
tar image of the
.Pn /usr
filesystem
.IP 4)
tar image of
.Pn /usr/src/sys
.IP 5)
tar image of the rest of
.Pn /usr/src
.IP 6)
(8mm tape only) tar image of
.Pn /usr/src/X11R5
.LP
The tape bootstrap procedure used to create a
working system involves the following major steps:
.IP 1)
Transfer a bootable root filesystem from the tape to a disk
and get it booted and running.
.IP 2)
Build and restore the
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /usr
filesystems from tape with
.Xr tar (1).
.IP 3)
Extract the system and utility source files as desired.
.PP
The following sections describe the above steps in detail.
The details of the first step vary between architectures.
The specific steps for the HP300, SPARC, and DECstation are
given in the next three sections respectively.
You should follow the instructions for your particular architecture.
In all sections,
commands you are expected to type are shown in italics, while that
information printed by the system is shown emboldened.

.TE
.LP
Major items not supported include the 310 and 332 CPUs, 400 series machines
configured for Domain/OS, EISA and VME bus adaptors, audio, the centronics
port, 1/2" tape drives (7980), CD-ROM, and the PVRX/TVRX 3D graphics displays.
.NH 3
Standalone device file naming
.LP
The standalone system device name syntax on the HP300 is of the form:
.DS
xx(a,c,u,p)
.DE
where
\fIxx\fP is the device type,
\fIa\fP specifies the adaptor to use,
\fIc\fP the controller,
\fIu\fP the unit, and
\fIp\fP a partition.
The \fIdevice type\fP differentiates the various disks and tapes and is one of:
``rd'' (HP-IB CS80 disks),
``ct'' (HP-IB CS80 cartridge tape),
``sd'' (SCSI-I disks) or
``st'' (SCSI-I tapes).
The \fIadaptor\fP field is a logical HP-IB or SCSI bus adaptor card number.
This will typically be
0 for SCSI disks and tapes,
0 for devices on the ``slow'' HP-IB interface (usually tapes) and
1 for devices on the ``fast'' HP-IB interface (usually disks).
To get a complete mapping of physical (select-code) to logical card numbers
just type a ^C at the standalone prompt.
The \fIcontroller\fP field is the disk or tape's target number on the
HP-IB or SCSI bus.
For SCSI the range is 0 to 6 (7 is the adaptor address) and
for HP-IB the range is 0 to 7.
The \fIunit\fP field is unused and should be 0.
The \fIpartition\fP field is interpreted differently for tapes
and disks: for disks it is a disk partition (in the range 0-7),
and for tapes it is a file number offset on the tape.
Thus, partition 2 of a SCSI disk drive at target 3 on SCSI bus 1
would be ``sd(1,3,0,2)''.
If you have only one of any type bus adaptor, you may omit the adaptor
and controller numbers;
e.g. ``sd(0,2)'' could be used instead of ``sd(0,0,0,2)''.
The following examples always use the full syntax for clarity.
.NH 3
The Procedure
.LP
The basic steps involved in bringing up the HP300 are as follows:
.IP 1)
Obtain a second disk and format it, if necessary.
.IP 2)
Copy a root filesystem from the
tape onto the beginning of the disk.
.IP 3)
Boot the UNIX system on the new disk.
.IP 4)
(Optional) Build a root filesystem optimized for your disk.
.IP 5)
Label the disks with the
.Xr disklabel (8)
program.
.NH 4
Step 1: formating a disk.
.PP
For your first system you will have to obtain a formatted disk
of a type given in the ``supported hardware'' list above.
Since most HP disk drives, with the exception of optical media,
come pre-formatted there should be nothing to do.
If necessary, you can format a disk under HP-UX using the
.Xr mediainit (1m)
program.
Once you have \*(4B up and running on one machine you can use
the
.Xr scsiformat (8)
program to format additional disks.
.NH 4
Step 2: copying the root filesystem from tape to disk
.PP
There are two approaches to getting the root filesystem from tape to disk.
If you have an extra disk, the easiest approach is to use
.Xr dd (1)
under HP-UX to copy the root filesystem image from the tape to the beginning
of the second disk.
For HPs, the root filesystem image is the first file on the tape.
It includes a disklabel and bootblock along with the root filesystem.
An example command to copy the image from tape to the beginning of a disk is:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=/dev/rmt/0m of=/dev/rdsk/1s0 bs=20b
.DE
The actual special file syntax may vary depending on unit numbers and
the version of HP-UX that is running.
Consult the HP-UX
.Xr mt (7)
and
.Xr disk (7)
man pages for details.
.PP
If you have only a single machine with a single disk,
you need to use the more difficult approach of booting a
standalone copy program, and using that to copy the
root filesystem image from the tape to the disk.
If your distribution is on 8mm tape and you have an 8mm drive attached
to the target machine, you should be able to boot from the distribution
tape directly.
If you have the 9-track distribution or only have a CS80 cartridge or
4mm DAT drive, you will need to create your own boot tape.
To do this, you need to extract the first file of the distribution tape
(the root image), copy it over to a machine with a supported HP tape
drive and then create a bootable cartridge or DAT tape.
For example:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=/dev/rst0 of=bootimage bs=20b
rcp bootimage foo:/tmp/bootimage
<login to foo>
dd if=/tmp/bootimage of=/dev/rct/0m bs=20b
.DE
Once this tape is created you can boot and run the standalone tape
copy program from it.
The copy program is loaded just as any other program would be loaded
by the bootrom in ``attended'' mode:
reset the CPU,
hold down the space bar until the word ``Keyboard'' appears in the
installed interface list, and
enter the menu selection for SYS_TCOPY.
Once loaded and running:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fBFrom:\fP \fI^C\fP	(control-C to see logical adaptor assignments)
\fBhpib0 at sc7\fP
\fBscsi0 at sc14\fP
\fBFrom:\fP \fIct(0,7,0,0)\fP	(HP-IB tape target 7, first tape file)
\fBTo:\fP \fIsd(0,0,0,2)\fP	(SCSI disk target 0, third disk partition)
\fBCopy completed: 2048 records copied\fP
.TE
.DE
.LP
This copy will likely take 30 minutes or more.
.NH 4
Step 3: booting the root filesystem
.PP
You now have a bootable root filesystem on the disk.
If you were previously running with two disks,
it would be best if you shut down the machine and turn off power on
the HP-UX drive.
It will be less confusing and it will eliminate any chance of accidentally
destroying the HP-UX disk.
Whether you booted from tape or copied from disk you should now reboot
the machine and perform another assisted boot, this time with SYS_TBOOT.
Once loaded and running the boot program will display the CPU type and
prompt for a kernel file to boot:
.DS
.B
HP433 CPU
Boot
.R
\fB:\fP \fI/vmunix\fP
.DE
.LP
After providing the kernel name, the machine will boot and run \*(4B with
output that looks approximately like this:
.DS

root device?
.R
.DE
.PP
The first three numbers are printed out by the bootstrap program and
are the sizes of different parts of the system (text, initialized and
uninitialized data).  The system also allocates several system data
structures after it starts running.  The sizes of these structures are
based on the amount of available memory and the maximum count of active
users expected, as declared in a system configuration description.  This
will be discussed later.
.PP
UNIX itself then runs for the first time and begins by printing out a banner
identifying the release and
version of the system that is in use and the date that it was compiled. 
.PP
Next the
.I mem
messages give the
amount of real (physical) memory and the
memory available to user programs
in bytes.
For example, if your machine has 16Mb bytes of memory, then
\fBxxx\fP will be 16777216.
.PP
The messages that come out next show what devices were found on
the current processor.  These messages are described in
.Xr autoconf (4).
The distributed system may not have
found all the communications devices you have
or all the mass storage peripherals you have, especially
if you have more than
two of anything.  You will correct this when you create
a description of your machine from which to configure a site-dependent
version of UNIX.
The messages printed at boot here contain much of the information
that will be used in creating the configuration.
In a correctly configured system most of the information
present in the configuration description
is printed out at boot time as the system verifies that each device
is present.
.PP
The \*(lqroot device?\*(rq prompt was printed by the system
to ask you for the name of the root filesystem to use.
This happens because the distribution system is a \fIgeneric\fP
system, i.e., it can be bootstrapped on a cpu with its root device
and paging area on any available disk drive.
You should respond to the root device question with ``\*(Dk0''.
This response indicates that
that the disk it is running on is drive 0 of type ``\*(Dk''.
You will later build a system tailored to your configuration
that will not ask this question when it is bootstrapped.
.DS
\fBroot device?\fP \fI\*(Dk0\fP
WARNING: preposterous time in filesystem \-\- CHECK AND RESET THE DATE!
\fBerase ^?, kill ^U, intr ^C\fP
\fB#\fP
.DE
.PP
The \*(lqerase ...\*(rq message is part of the
.Pn /.profile
that was executed by the root shell when it started.  This message
is present to inform you as to what values the character erase,
line erase, and interrupt characters have been set.
.NH 4
Step 4: (optional) restoring the root filesystem
.PP
UNIX is now running,
and the \fIUNIX Programmer's manual\fP applies.  The ``#'' is the prompt
from the Bourne shell, and lets you know that you are the super-user,
whose login name is \*(lqroot\*(rq.
.PP
The root filesystem that you are currently running on is complete,
however it probably is not optimally laid out for the disk on
which you are running.
If you will be cloning copies of the system onto multiple disks for
other machines, you are advised to connect one of these disks to
this machine, and build and restore a properly laid out root filesystem
onto it.
If this is the only machine on which you will be running \*(4B
or peak performance is not an issue, you can skip this step and
proceed directly to step 5.
.PP
Connect a second disk to your machine.
If you bootstrapped using the two disk method, you can
overwrite your initial bootstrapping disk, as it will no longer
be needed.
.PP
To actually create the root filesystem on drive 1
you should first label the disk as described in step 5 below.
Then run the following commands:
.DS
\fB#\fP\|\fInewfs /dev/r\*(Dk1a\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fImount /dev/\*(Dk1a /mnt\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fIcd /mnt\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fIdump 0f \- /dev/r\(*Dk0a | restore xf \-\fP
(Note: restore will ask if you want to ``set owner/mode for '.'''
to which you should reply ``yes''.)
.DE
.PP
This will generate many messages regarding the construction
of the filesystem and the restoration of the tape contents,
but should eventually stop with the message:
.DS
 ...
\fBRoot filesystem extracted\fP
\fB#\fP
.DE
.PP
You should then shut down the system, and boot on the disk that
you just created following the procedure in step (3) above.
.NH 4
Step 5: placing labels on the disks
.PP
\*(4B uses disk labels in the first sector of each disk to contain
information about the geometry of the drive and the partition layout.
This information is written with
.Xr disklabel (8).
.PP
For each disk that you wish to label, run the following command:
.DS
\fB#\|\fP\fIdisklabel  -rw  \*(Dk\fP\fB#\fP  \fBtype\fP  \fI"optional_pack_name"\fP
.DE
The \fB#\fP is the unit number; the \fBtype\fP is the HP300 disk device
name as listed in section 2.2.1 or any other name listed in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
The optional information may contain any descriptive name for the
contents of a disk, and may be up to 16 characters long.  This procedure
will place the label on the disk using the information found in
.Pn /etc/disktab
for the disk type named.
If you have changed the disk partition sizes,
you may wish to add entries for the modified configuration in
.Pn /etc/disktab
before labeling the affected disks.
.PP
You have now completed the HP300 specific part of the installation.
You should now proceed to the generic part of the installation
described starting in section 2.5 below.

.LP
Major items not supported include the GX (cgnine) display,
the floppy disk, and SCSI tapes.
.NH 3
Limitations
.LP
There are several important limitations on the \*(4B distribution
for the SPARC:
.IP 1)
You MUST have SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris in order to bring up \*(4B.
There is no SPARCstation bootstrap code in this distribution.  The
Sun-supplied boot loader will be used to boot \*(4B; you must copy
this from your SunOS distribution.  This imposes a number of
restrictions on the system, as detailed below.
.IP 2)
The \*(4B SPARC kernel does not remap SCSI IDs.  A SCSI disk at
target 0 will become ``sd0'', where in SunOS the same disk will
normally be called ``sd3''.  If your existing SunOS system is
diskful, it will be least painful to have SunOS running on the disk
on target 0 lun 0 and put \*(4B on the disk on target 3 lun 0.  Both
systems will then think they are running on ``sd0'', and you can
boot either system as needed simply by changing the EEPROM's boot
device.
.IP 3)
There is no SCSI tape driver.
You must have another system for tape reading and backups.
.IP 4)
Although the \*(4B SPARC kernel will handle existing SunOS shared
libraries, it does not use or create them itself, and therefore
requires quite a bit more disk space than SunOS does.
.IP 5)
It is currently difficult (though not completely impossible) to
run \*(4B diskless.  These instructions assume you will have a local
boot, swap, and root filesystem.
.NH 3
The Procedure
.PP
You must have a spare disk on which to place \*(4B.
The steps involved in bootstrapping this tape are as follows:
.IP 1)
Bring up SunOS (preferably SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris 1.x, although
Solaris 2 may work \(em this is untested).
.IP 2)
Attach auxiliary SCSI disk(s).  Format and label using the
SunOS formating and labeling programs as needed.
Note that the root filesystem currently requires at least 10 MB; 16 MB
or more is recommended.  The b partition will be used for swap;
this should be at least 32 MB.
.IP 3)
Use the SunOS ``newfs'' to build the root filesystem.  You may also
want to build other filesystems at the same time.  (By default, the
\*(4B newfs builds a filesystem that SunOS will not handle; if you
plan to switch OSes back and forth you may want to sacrifice the
performance gain from the new filesystem format for compatibility.)
You can build an old-format filesystem on \*(4B by giving the \-O
option to
.Xr newfs (8).
.Xr Fsck (8)
can convert old format filesystems to new format
filesystems, but not vice versa,
so you may want to initially build old format filesystems so that they
can be mounted under SunOS,
and then later convert them to new format filesystems when you are
satisfied that \*(4B is running properly.
In any case, YOU MUST BUILD AN OLD-STYLE ROOT FILE SYSTEM
so that the SunOS boot program will work.
.IP 4)
Mount the new root, then copy the SunOS
.Pn /boot
into place and use the SunOS ``installboot'' program
to enable disk-based booting:
.DS
.ft CW
# mount /dev/sd3a /mnt
# cp /boot /mnt/boot
# umount /dev/sd3a
# /usr/kvm/mdec/installboot installboot bootsd /dev/rsd3a
.DE
The SunOS
.Pn /boot
will load \*(4B kernels; there is no SPARCstation
bootstrap code on the distribution.  Note that the SunOS
.Pn /boot
does not handle the new \*(4B filesystem format.
.IP 5)
Mount the new root and restore the root.
.DS
.ft CW
# mount /dev/sd3a /mnt
# cd /mnt
# rrestore xf tapehost:/dev/nrst0
.DE
If you have chosen to use the SunOS newfs to build
.Pn /usr ,
you may mount and restore it now and skip the next step.
.IP 6)
Boot the supplied kernel.  Configure the network, build
.Pn /usr ,
mount it, and restore it:
.DS
.ft CW
# halt
ok boot disk3 -s			[for old proms] OR
ok boot sd(0,3)vmunix -s		[for new proms]
\&... [\*(4B boot messages]
# ifconfig le0 [your address, subnet, etc, as needed]
# newfs /dev/rsd0g
\&... [newfs output, including a warning about being unable to
     update the label \(em ignore this]
# mount /dev/sd0g /usr
# cd /usr
# rrestore xf tapehost:/dev/nrst0
.DE
.IP 7)
At this point you may wish to set up \*(4B to reboot automatically:
.DS
.ft CW
# halt
ok setenv boot-from sd(0,3)vmunix	[for old proms] OR
ok setenv boot-device disk3		[for new proms]
.DE
If you build backwards-compatible filesystems, either with the SunOS
newfs or with the \*(4B ``\-O'' option, you can mount these under
SunOS.  The SunOS fsck will, however, always think that these filesystems
are corrupted, as there are several new (previously unused)
superblock fields that are updated in \*(4B.  Running ``fsck \-b32''
and letting it ``fix'' the superblock will take care of this.
.sp 0.5
If you wish to run SunOS binaries that use SunOS shared libraries, you
simply need to copy all of the dynamic linker files from an existing
SunOS system:
.DS
.ft CW
# rcp sunos-host:/etc/ld.so.cache /etc/
# rcp sunos-host:'/usr/lib/*.so*' /usr/lib/
.DE
The SunOS compiler and linker should be able to produce SunOS binaries
under \*(4B, but this has not been tested.  If you plan to try it you
will need the appropriate .sa files as well.

Major items not supported include the 5000/240 (there is code but not
compiled in or tested),
R4000 based machines, FDDI and audio interfaces.
Diskless machines are not supported but booting kernels and bootstrapping
over the network is supported on the 5000 series.
.NH 3
The Procedure
.PP
The first file on the distribution tape is a tar file which contains
four files.
The first step requires a running UNIX (or ULTRIX) system that can
be used to extract the tar archive from the first file on the tape.
The command:
.DS
.ft CW
tar xf /dev/rmt0
.DE
will extract the following four files:
.DS
A) root.image: \fIdd\fP image of the root filesystem
B) vmunix.tape: \fIdd\fP image for creating boot tapes
C) vmunix.net: file for booting over the network
D) root.dump: dump image of the root filesystem
.DE
There are three basic ways a system can be bootstrapped corresponding to the
first three files.
You may want to read the section on bootstrapping the HP300
since many of the steps are similar.
A spare, formatted SCSI disk is also useful.
.NH 4
Procedure A: copy root filesystem to disk
.PP
This procedure is similar to the HP300.
If you have an extra disk, the easiest approach is to use \fIdd\fP\|(1)
under ULTRIX to copy the root filesystem image to the beginning
of the spare disk. 
The root filesystem image includes a disklabel and bootblock along with the
root filesystem.
An example command to copy the image to the beginning of a disk is:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=root.image of=/dev/rz1c bs=20b
.DE
The actual special file syntax will vary depending on unit numbers and
the version of ULTRIX that is running.
This system is now ready to boot. You can boot the kernel with one of the
following PROM commands. If you are booting on a 3100, the disk must be SCSI
id zero due to a bug.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:    boot \-f rz(0,0,0)vmunix
DEC 5000:    boot 5/rz0/vmunix
.DE
You will probably want to change the disk label
to create reasonable partitions for your machine (see section 4.2).
You can then proceed to section 2.5 to install the rest of the system.
.NH 4
Procedure B: bootstrap from tape
.PP
If you have only a single machine with a single disk,
you need to use the more difficult approach of booting a
kernel and mini-root from tape or the network, and using it to restore
the root filesystem.
.PP
First, you will need to create a boot tape. This can be done using
\fIdd\fP as in the following example.
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=vmunix.tape of=/dev/nrmt0 bs=1b
dd if=root.dump of=/dev/nrmt0 bs=20b
.DE
The actual special file syntax for the tape drive will vary depending on
unit numbers, tape device and the version of ULTRIX that is running.
.PP
The first file on the boot tape contains a boot header, kernel, and
mini-root file system that the PROM can copy into memory.
Installing from tape has only been tested
on a 3100 and a 5000/200 using a TK50 tape drive. Here are two example
PROM commands to boot from tape.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:    boot \-f tz(0,5,0) m    # 5 is the SCSI id of the TK50
DEC 5000:    boot 5/tz6 m           # 6 is the SCSI id of the TK50
.DE
The `m' argument tells the kernel to look for a root filesystem in memory.
Next you should proceed to section 2.4.3 to build a disk-based root filesystem.
.NH 4
Procedure C: bootstrap over the network
.PP
You will need a host machine that is running the \fIbootp\fP server 
with the vmunix.net file installed in the default directory defined by the
configuration file for \fIbootp\fP.
Here are two example PROM commands to boot across the net:
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:	boot \-f tftp()vmunix.net m
DEC 5000:	boot 6/tftp/vmunix.net m
.DE
This command should load the kernel and mini-root into memory and
run the same as the tape install (procedure B).
The rest of the steps are the same except you will need to
execute the following to start the networking:
.DS
.ft CW
# mount -u /
# echo 127.0.0.1 localhost >> /etc/hosts
# echo <your.host.inet.number> myname.my.domain myname >> /etc/hosts
# echo <friend.host.inet.number> myfriend.my.domain myfriend >> /etc/hosts
# ifconfig le0 inet myname
.DE
Next you should proceed to section 2.4.3 to build a disk-based root filesystem.
.NH 3
Label disk and create the root filesystem.
.LP
There are five steps to create a disk-based root filesystem.
.IP 1)
Label the disk.
.DS
.ft CW
# disklabel -W /dev/rrz?c		# This enables writing the label
# disklabel -w -r -B /dev/rrz?c $DISKTYPE
# newfs /dev/rrz?a
\&...
# fsck /dev/rrz?a
\&...
.DE
Supported disk types are listed in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
.IP 2)
Restore the root filesystem.
.DS
.ft CW
# mount \-u /
# mount /dev/rz?a /a
# cd /a
.DE
.ti +0.4i
If you are restoring locally (procedure B), run:
.DS
.ft CW
# mt \-f /dev/nrmt0 rew
# restore \-xsf 2 /dev/rmt0
.DE
.ti +0.4i
If you are restoring across the net (procedure c), run:
.DS
.ft CW
# rrestore xf myfriend:/path/to/root.dump
.DE
.ti +0.4i
When the restore finishes, clean up with:
.DS
.ft CW
# cd /
# sync
# umount /a
# fsck /dev/rz?a
.DE
.IP 3)
Reset the system and initialize the PROM monitor to boot automatically.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:	setenv bootpath boot \-f rz(0,?,0)vmunix
DEC 5000:	setenv bootpath 5/rz?/vmunix -a
.DE
.IP 4)
After booting UNIX, you will need to create
.Pn /dev/mouse
to run X windows as in the following example.
.DS
.ft CW
rm /dev/mouse
ln /dev/xx /dev/mouse
.DE
The 'xx' should be one of the following:
.DS
pm0	raw interface to PMAX graphics devices
cfb0	raw interface to turbochannel PMAG-BA color frame buffer
xcfb0	raw interface to maxine graphics devices
mfb0	raw interface to mono graphics devices
.DE
You can then proceed to section 2.5 to install the rest of the system.
.NH 2
Installing the rest of the system
.PP
All architectures now have a root filesystem up and running and
proceed from this point to extract the rest of the data from the tape.
At a minimum you need to set up the
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /usr
filesystems.
You may also want to extract some or all the program sources.
You might wish to review the disk configuration information in section
4.2 before continuing; the partitions used below are those most appropriate
in size.
.PP
Then do the following:
.br
.ne 5
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIdate yymmddhhmm\fP	(set date, see \fIdate\fP\|(1))
\&....
\fB#\fP \fIpasswd root\fP	(set password for super-user)
\fBNew password:\fP	(password will not echo)
\fBRetype new password:\fP
\fB#\fP \fIhostname mysitename\fP	(set your hostname)
\fB#\fP \fInewfs r\*(Dk#c\fP	(create empty user filesystem)
(\fI\*(Dk\fP is the disk type, \fI#\fP is the unit number, \fIc\fP
is the partition; this takes a few minutes)
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk#c /var\fP	(mount the var filesystem)
\fB#\fP \fIcd /var\fP	(make /var the current directory)
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
\fB#\fP \fItar xbpf 40 /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP	(extract all of var)
\fB#\fP \fInewfs r\*(Dk#c\fP	(create empty user filesystem)
(as before \fI\*(Dk\fP is the disk type, \fI#\fP is the unit number, \fIc\fP
is the partition)
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk#c /usr\fP	(mount the usr filesystem)
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr\fP	(make /usr the current directory)
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
\fB#\fP \fItar xbpf 40 /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP	(extract all of usr except usr/src)
(this takes about 15-20 minutes)
.TE
.DE
If no disk label has been installed on the disk, the
.Xr newfs
command will require a third argument to specify the disk type,
using one of the names in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
If the tape had been rewound or positioned incorrectly before the
.Xr tar ,
to extract
.Pn /var
it may be repositioned by the following commands.
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 rew\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf 3\fP
.DE
The data on the fifth tape file has now been extracted.
If you are using 6250bpi tapes, the first reel of the
distribution is no longer needed; you should now mount the second
reel instead.  The installation procedure continues from this
point on the 8mm tape.
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fImkdir src\fP	(make directory for source)
\fB#\fP \fIcd src\fP	(make source directory the current directory)
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf 40 /dev/rmt12\fP 	(extract the system source)
(this takes about 5-10 minutes)
\fB#\fP \fIcd /\fP	(change directory, back to the root)
\fB#\fP \fIchmod 755  /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fIumount /dev/\*(Dk#c\fP	(unmount /usr)
.TE

.PP
You can check the consistency of the
.Pn /usr
filesystem by doing
.DS
\fB#\fP \fIfsck /dev/r\*(Dk#c\fP
.DE
The output from
.Xr fsck
should look something like:
.DS
.B
** /dev/r\*(Dk#c
** Last Mounted on /usr
** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes
** Phase 2 - Check Pathnames
** Phase 3 - Check Connectivity
** Phase 4 - Check Reference Counts
** Phase 5 - Check Cyl groups
671 files, 3497 used, 137067 free (75 frags, 34248 blocks)
.R
.DE
.PP
If there are inconsistencies in the filesystem, you may be prompted
to apply corrective action; see the
.Xr fsck (8)
or \fIFsck \(en The UNIX File System Check Program\fP (SMM:3) for more details.
.PP
To use the
.Pn /usr
filesystem, you should now remount it with:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fI/sbin/mount /dev/\*(Dk#c /usr\fP
.DE
.PP
If you are using 6250bpi tapes, the second reel of the
distribution is no longer needed; you should now mount the third
reel instead.  The installation procedure continues from this
point on the 8mm tape.
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /usr/src/sys\fP
\fB#\fP \fIchmod 755 /usr/src/sys\fP
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src/sys\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf 40 /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP
.DE
.PP
If you received a distribution on 8mm tape,
there is one additional tape file on the distribution tape
which has not been installed to this point; it contains the
sources for X11R5 in
.Xr tar (1)
format.  As distributed, X11R5 should be placed in
.Pn /usr/src/X11R5 .
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /usr/src/X11R5\fP
\fB#\fP \fIchmod 755 /usr/src/X11R5\fP
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src/X11R5\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -t /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf 40 /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP
.DE
.NH 2
Additional conversion information
.PP
After setting up the new \*(4B filesystems, you may restore the user
files that were saved on tape before beginning the conversion.
Note that the \*(4B
.Xr restore
program does its work on a mounted filesystem using normal system operations.
This means that filesystem dumps may be restored even
if the characteristics of the filesystem changed.
To restore a dump tape for, say, the
.Pn /a
filesystem something like the following would be used:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fInewfs \*(Dk#c\fI
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk#c /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fIcd /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fIrestore x\fP
.DE
.PP
If
.Xr tar
images were written instead of doing a dump, you should
be sure to use its `\-p' option when reading the files back.  No matter
how you restore a filesystem, be sure to unmount it and and check its
integrity with
.Xr fsck (8)
when the job is complete.
