This paper gives a brief overview of the contributions to UNIX
made by the research community and describes the needs that
prompted the distributions from Berkeley.
The next Berkeley system will attempt to adapt to the
current state of technology in the areas of virtual memory 
and file system interfaces.
The paper makes a brief survey of this available technological base
and then speculates on the ways in which future
Berkeley systems will use this technology.
