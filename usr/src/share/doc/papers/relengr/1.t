Introduction

.SM CSRG
has always been a small group of software developers.
This resource limitation requires careful software-engineering management.
Careful coordination is needed not only of
.SM CSRG
personnel, but also of members of the general community who
contribute to the development of the system.

Releases from Berkeley tend to alternate between
those that introduce major new facilities and those that introduce
bug fixes and efficiency improvements.
This alternation allows timely releases,
while providing for refinement and correction of the new facilities
and the elimination of performance problems produced by the new facilities.
The timely followup of releases that include new facilities
reflects the importance
.SM CSRG
places on providing a reliable and robust system on which its
user community can depend.

The development of
.SM BSD
illustrates an \fIadvantage\fP of having a few
principal developers:
The developers all know the whole system thoroughly enough
to be able to coordinate their own work with
that of other people to produce a coherent final system.
Companies with large development organizations find
this result difficult to duplicate.
This paper describes in more detail the process by which
the development effort is managed.
