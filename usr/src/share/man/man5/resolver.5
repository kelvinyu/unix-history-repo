.SH NAME
resolver configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The resolver configuration file contains information that is read
by the resolver routines the first time they are invoked in a process.
The file is designed to be human readable and contains a list of
name-value pairs that provide various types of resolver information.
.LP
The different configuration options are:
.TP
\fBnameserver\fP
followed by the Internet address (in dot notation) of a name server
that the resolver should query.  At least one name server should be
listed.  Up to MAXNS (currently 3) name servers may be listed, in that
case the resolver library queries tries them in the order listed.
(The algorithm used is to try a name server, and if the query times out,
try the next, until out of name servers, then repeat trying all the name servers
until a maximum number of retries are made).
.TP
\fBdomain\fP
followed by a domain name, that is
the default domain to append to names that do not have a dot in them.
This defaults to empty (the root domain).
.LP
The name value pair must appear on a single line, and the keyword
(e.g. \fBnameserver\fP) must start the line.  The value follows
the keyword, separated by white space.
