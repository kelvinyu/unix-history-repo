.SH NAME
mem, kmem \- main memory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.lg
.I Mem
is a special file that is an image of the main memory
of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine
(and even to patch) the system.
.PP
Byte addresses in
.I mem
are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.
.PP
The file
.I kmem
is the same as 
.I mem
except that kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
Only kernel virtual addresses that are mapped to memory are allowed.
Examining and patching device registers is likely
to lead to unexpected results when read-only or write-only
bits are present.
.PP
On ISA the I/O memory space begins at physical address 0x000a0000
and runs to 0x00100000.
Per-process data for the current process is UPAGES long, and ends at virtual
address 0xfe000000.
