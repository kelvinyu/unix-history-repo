.SH NAME
cons \- VAX-11 console interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The console is available to the processor through the console registers.
It acts like a normal terminal, except that when the local functions are
not disabled, control-P puts the console in local console mode (where
the prompt is ``>>>'').  The operation of the console in this mode varies
slightly per-processor.
.PP
On an 11/780 you can return to the conversational mode using the command
``set t p'' (set terminal program) if the processor is still
running or ``continue'' if it is halted.
The latter command may be abbreviated ``c''.
If you hit the break key on the console, then the console will go into ODT
(console debugger mode).  Hit a ``P'' (upper-case letter p)
to get out of this mode.
.PP
On an 11/750
or an 11/730
the processor is halted whenever the console is not in conversational mode,
and typing ``C'' returns to conversational mode.
When in console mode on an 11/750 which has a remote diagnosis module,
a ^D will put you in remote diagnosis mode, where the prompt will be ``RDM>''.
The command ``ret'' will return from remote diagnosis mode to local console
mode.
.PP
With the above proviso's the console works like any other UNIX terminal.
