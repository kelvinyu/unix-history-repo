.Sh NAME
.Nm tmscp
.Nd
.Tn DEC TMSCP
magtape interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "controller tmscp0 at uba? csr 0174500 vector tmscpintr"
.Cd "tape tms0 at tmscp0 drive 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Tape controllers compatible with the
.Tn DEC
Tape Mass Storage Control Protocol
.Pq Tn TMSCP
architecture
such as the
.Tn TU81
and the
.Tn TK50
provide a standard tape drive interface 
as described in
.Xr mtio 4 .
The controller communicates with the host through a packet
oriented protocol.
Consult the file
.Aq Pa vax/tmscp.h
for a detailed 
description of this protocol.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It tmscp controller failed to init.
The controller initialization procedure failed.
This probably indicates a hardware problem.
.Pp
.It tmscp%d: sa 0%o, state %d.
(Additional status information given after a hard
.Tn I/O
error.)
The values of the controller status register and the internal
driver state are printed.
.Pp
.It tmscp%d: random interrupt ignored.
An unexpected interrupt was received (e.g. when no
.Tn I/O
was
pending).  The interrupt is ignored.
.Pp
.It tmscp%d:  interrupt in unknown state %d ignored.
An interrupt was received when the driver was in an unknown
internal state.  Indicates a hardware problem or a driver bug.
.Pp
.It tmscp%d:  fatal error (0%o).
The controller detected a ``fatal error'' in the status returned
to the host.  The contents of the status register are displayed.
.Pp
.It OFFLINE.
(Additional status information given after a hard
.Tn I/O
error.)
A hard
.Tn I/O
error occurred because the drive was not on-line.
.Pp
.It tmscp%d: hard error
.It tmscp%d: soft error.
These errors precede an interpretation of a
.Tn TMSCP
error message
returned by the controller to the host.
.Tn TMSCP
errors may be:
.Pp
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.It controller error, event 0%o.
.It host memory access error, event 0%o, addr 0%o.
.It tape transfer error, unit %d, grp 0x%x, event 0%o.
.It STI error, unit %d, event 0%o.
.It STI Drive Error Log, unit %d, event 0%o.
.It STI Formatter Error Log, unit %d, event 0%o.
.It unknown error, unit %d, format 0%o, event 0%o.
