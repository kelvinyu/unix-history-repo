.SH NAME
tu \- console TU58 interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a simple interface to the TU58
cassette tape unit, which is part of the console
subsytem for VAX-11/750's.
Access is given to the entire
tape consisting of 1024 blocks of 512 bytes.
.PP
The TU58 behaves like a disk but has only a block interface (no raw).
The cassette is commonly accessed via the
.IR arff (8)
command, using the `m' flag.
.SH FILES
/dev/floppy
.SH SEE ALSO
arff(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Lots, mostly cryptic.  Read the driver.
.SH BUGS
The driver is very unreliable due to the nature of the TU58 interface.
The TU58 should be used only when the system is in single-user mode,
since it is often necessary to reboot the system to unhang the process
accessing the TU58.
