.Tn VAX
8600 console
.Tn RL Ns 02
interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a simple interface to the
.Tn DEC
.Tn RL Ns 02
disk unit which is part of the console
subsystem on the
.Tn VAX
8600 and 8650.
Access is given to the entire
.Tn RL Ns 02
disk; the pack format is the same
as that of
.Tn RL Ns 02
disks on other controllers.
As on other
.Tn VAX
console media, transfers are done a word at a time
using privileged registers (i.e., slowly).
.Pp
All
.Tn I/O
is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should be a multiple
of 512 bytes and a multiple of 512 bytes should be transferred,
as in other
.Dq raw
disk interfaces.
(Although the sector size is actually 256 bytes, the driver allows
operations only on 512-byte boundaries.)
