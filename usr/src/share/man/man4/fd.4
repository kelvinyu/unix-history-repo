.SH NAME
fd, stdin, stdout, stderr \- file descriptor files
.SH DESCRIPTION
The files
.I /dev/fd/0
through
.I /dev/fd/#
refer to file descriptors which can be accessed through the file
system.
If the file descriptor is open and the mode the file is being opened
with is a subset of the mode of the existing descriptor, the call:
.sp
.RS
fd = open("/dev/fd/0", mode);
.RE
.sp
and the call:
.sp
.RS
fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);
.RE
.sp
are equivalent.
.PP
Opening the files
.IR /dev/stdin ,
.I /dev/stdout
and
.I /dev/stderr
is equivalent to the following calls:
.sp
.RS
fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);
.br
fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);
.br
fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);
.RE
.PP
Flags to the
.IR open (2)
call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are ignored.
