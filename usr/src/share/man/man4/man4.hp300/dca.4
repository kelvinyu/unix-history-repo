.SH NAME
dca \- HP 98644A communications interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device		dca0	at scode9 flags 0x1"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 98644A is a single port EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28)
communications interface with a single character buffer.
Such an interface is built-in to all series 300 machines.
.PP
Each 98644A line behaves as described in
.IR tty (4).
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200. See 
.IR tty (4)
for the encoding.
.PP
Flags should be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired
with carrier always present or 0 if modem control is desired.
.SH FILES
/dev/tty0
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tty(4)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBdca%d: silo overflow\fR.  The single-character input ``silo''
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.SH BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with baud rates greater than 300.
The
.I dca
has never been tested with modem control enabled or on anything but the
built-in interface.
