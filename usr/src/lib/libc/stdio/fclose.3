fclose(FILE *stream);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fclose
dissociates the named

from its underlying file or set of functions.
If the stream was being used for output, any buffered data is written
first, using
.IR fflush (3).

close(2), fflush(3), fopen(3), setbuf(3)
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,

is set to indicate the error.
In either case no further access to the stream is possible. 
.SH ERRORS
