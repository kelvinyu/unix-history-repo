.SH NAME
stdio \- standard buffered input/output package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.PP
.SM
.B FILE
.B *stdin;
.br
.SM
.B FILE
.B *stdout;
.br
.SM
.B FILE
.B *stderr;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions described here constitute a user-level buffering scheme.
The in-line macros
.IR getc (3)
and
.IR putc (3)
handle characters quickly.
The higher level routines in
.I stdio
all use
.I getc
and
.IR putc ;
they can be freely intermixed.
.PP
A file with associated buffering is called a
.IR stream ,
and is declared to be a pointer to a defined type
.SM
.BR FILE .
.IR Fopen (3)
and
.IR funopen (3)
create certain descriptive data for a stream
and return a pointer to designate the stream in all further transactions.
There are three normally open streams with constant pointers declared in
the include file and associated with the standard open files:
.TP 10n
.B stdin
standard input file
.br
.ns
.TP
.B stdout
standard output file
.br
.ns
.TP
.B stderr
standard error file
.PP
A constant `pointer'
.SM
.B NULL
(0)
designates no stream at all.
.PP
An integer constant
.SM
.B EOF
(\-1) is returned upon end of file or error by integer functions that
deal with streams.
.PP
Any routine that uses the standard input/output package
must include the header file
.RI < stdio.h > .
The constants and functions listed here
are declared in the include file and need no further declaration.
The following are implemented as macros;
these names may not be reused
without first removing their current definitions with
.BR #undef :
.IR NULL ,
.IR BUFSIZ ,
.IR EOF ,
.IR FOPEN_MAX ,
.IR FILENAME_MAX ,
.IR L_tmpnam ,
.IR SEEK_SET ,
.IR SEE_CUR ,
.IR SEEK_END ,
.IR TMP_MAX ,
.IR stdin ,
.IR stdout ,
.IR stderr ,
.IR fropen ,
.IR fwopen ,
.IR feof ,
.IR ferror ,
.IR clearerr ,
.IR fileno ,
.IR getc ,
.IR getchar ,
.IR putc ,
.IR putchar ,
.IR L_cuserid .
Function versions of the macro functions
.IR feof ,
.IR ferror ,
.IR clearerr ,
.IR fileno ,
.IR getc ,
.IR getchar ,
.IR putc ,
and
.I putchar
exist and will be used if the macros definitions are explicitly removed.
.PP
Output streams that refer to terminal devices
are always line buffered by default;
pending output to such streams is written automatically
whenever an input stream that refers to a terminal device is read.
In cases where a large amount of computation is done after printing
part of a line on an output terminal, it is necessary to
.IR fflush (3)
the standard output before going off and computing so that the output
will appear.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
open(2), close(2), read(2), write(2)
.br
all of the manuals listed below
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The value
.SM
.B EOF
is returned uniformly to indicate that a
.SM
.B FILE
pointer has not been initialized with
.IR fopen ,
input (output) has been attempted on an output (input) stream, or a
.SM
.B FILE
pointer designates corrupt or otherwise unintelligible
.SM
.B FILE
data.
.SH BUGS
The standard buffered functions do not interact well with certain other
library and system functions, especially \fIvfork\fP and \fIabort\fP.
