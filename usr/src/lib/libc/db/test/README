#	@(#)README	5.1 (Berkeley) %G%

The script file consists of lines with a initial character which is
the "command" for that line.  Legal characters are as follows:

g: do a get command
	+ must be followed by [kK]
	+ writes out the retrieved data DBT.
p: do a put command
	+ must be followed by [kK][dD]
r: do a del command
	+ must be followed by [kK]
s: do a seq command
	+ writes out the retrieved key and data DBT's
f: set the flags for the next command
	+ no value zero's the flags
D [file]: data file
	+ set the current data value to the contents of the file
d [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.
K [file]: key file
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the file
k [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.

Options to dbtest are as follows:

	-i: Use the rest of the argument to set elements in the info
	    structure.  If the type is btree, then "-i cachesize=10240"
	    will set BTREEINFO.cachesize to 10240.
	-o: The rest of the argument is the output file instead of
	    using stdout.
	-t: Set the type of access, either "btree", "hash" or "recno".
