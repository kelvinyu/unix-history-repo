This package implements a superset of the hsearch and dbm/ndbm libraries.

Contents:

Hashing Package:
	dynahash.c
	page.c
	buf.c
	big.c
	hfunc.c
	log2.c

	hash.h
	page.h
	db.h

Backward Compatibility Routines:
	ndbm.c
	ndbm.h
	hsearch.c
	search.h

Misc
	byte_order.c

BSD Files:
	endian.h
	mkstemp.c
	bcopy.c

Test Programs:
	All test programs which need key/data pairs expect them entered
	with key and data on separate lines

	tcreat3.c	
		Takes 
			bucketsize (bsize), 
			fill factor (ffactor), and
			initial number of elements (nelem).  
		Creates a hash table named hashtest containing the 
		keys/data pairs entered from standard in.
	thash4.c
		Takes
			bucketsize (bsize), 
			fill factor (ffactor), 
			initial number of elements (nelem)
			bytes of cache (ncached), and
			file from which to read data  (fname)
		Creates a table from the key/data pairs on standard in and
		then does a read of each key/data in fname
	tdel.c
		Takes
			bucketsize (bsize), and
			fill factor (ffactor).
			file from which to read data (fname)
		Reads each key/data pair from fname and deletes the
		key from the hash table hashtest
	tseq.c
		Reads the key/data pairs in the file hashtest and writes them
		to standard out.
	tread2.c
		Takes
			butes of cache (ncached).
		Reads key/data pairs from standard in and looks them up
		in the file hashtest.
	tverify.c
		Reads key/data pairs from standard in, looks them up
		in the file hashtest, and verifies that the data is
		correct.

If you are running on a BSD system, the BSD h files should be in 
/usr/include and the BSD .c files should be in libc.  On a non-BSD 
system, you will need to compile the copies here into the package.  
Be sure to set BYTE_ORDER in endian.h appropriately for your machine.  
If you don't know what "endian" your machine is, compile byte_order.c 
and run it.  It should tell you.

The file search.h is used only for using the hsearch compatible interface on
BSD systems.  On System V derived systems, search.h should appear in 
/usr/include.

The man page db.3 explains the interface to the hashing system.
The file hash.ps is a postscript copy of a paper explaining
the history, implementation, and performance of the hash package.
