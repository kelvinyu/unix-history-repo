.Fn strncmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

functions
lexicographically compare the null-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and

.Fn strncmp
return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according
as the string
.Fa s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the string
.Fa s2 .
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that
.Ql \e200
is greater than
.Ql \e0 .
.Pp
The
.Fn strncmp
compares not more than
.Fa len
characters.
