 * pushed on the stack last contains the rest of the elements.  In this case,
 * stack growth is bounded by:

 *
 * This is a very large number, 102,261,125 for the maximum 32-bit signed
 * integer if NPARTITION is 20.
 *
 * By forcing the largest bucket to be pushed on the stack first, the worst
 * case is when all but two buckets each contain (__rspartition + 1) elements,
 * with the remaining elements split equally between the first and last
 * buckets pushed on the stack.  In this case, stack growth is bounded by
 * the recurrence relation:
 *
 * nelements_max[1] = (NBINS-1) * (__rspartition + 1);
 * nelements_max[i] = (NBINS-3) * (__rspartition + 1) + 2 * npartitions[i-1];
 * which resolves to:
 * nelements_max[i] = ((NBINS-2) * (2^i - 1) + 1) * (__rspartitions + 1),
 *
 * which yields, for a given nelements,
 *
 * i = ceil(log2((((nelements / (__rspartition + 1)) - 1) / (NBINS - 2)) + 1));
 *
 * The bound is:
 *
 *	limit = i * (NBINS - 1);
 *
 * This is a much smaller number, 4845 for the maximum 32-bit signed int.
