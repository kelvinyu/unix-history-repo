.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
These interfaces are obsoleted by random(3).
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn rand
function computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range
of 0 to
.Dv RAND_MAX
(as defined by the header file
.Aq Pa stdlib.h ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn srand
function sets its argument as the seed for a new sequence of
pseudo-random numbers to be returned by
.Fn rand .
These sequences are repeatable by calling
.Fn srand
with the same seed value.
.Pp
If no seed value is provided, the functions are automatically
seeded with a value of 1.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
