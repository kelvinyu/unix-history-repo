.Sh BUGS
This manual page represents intent instead of actual practice.
While it is intended that
.Fn atof
be implemented using
.Xr strtod 3 ,
this has not yet happened.
In the current system,
.Fn atof
translates a string in the following form to a double: a string of
leading white space, possibly followed by a sign (``+'' or ``-''),
followed by a digit string which may contain one decimal point (``.''),
which may be followed by either of the exponent flags (``E'' or ``e''),
and lastly, followed by a signed or unsigned integer.
