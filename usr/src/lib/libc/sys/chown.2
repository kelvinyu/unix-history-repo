.SH NAME
chown \- change owner and group of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
chown(path, owner, group)
char *path;
int owner, group;
.PP
.ft B
fchown(fd, owner, group)
int fd, owner, group;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
that is named by \fIpath\fP or referenced by \fIfd\fP
has its
.I owner
and 
.I group
changed as specified.
Only the super-user may
execute this call,
because if users were able to give files away,
they could defeat the file-space accounting procedures.
.PP
On some systems,
.I chown
clears the set-user-id and set-group-id bits
on the file
to prevent accidental creation of
set-user-id and set-group-id programs
owned by the super-user.
.PP
.I Fchown
is particularly useful when used in conjunction
with the file locking primitives (see
.IR flock (2)).
.PP
Only one of the owner and group id's
may be set by specifying the other as \-1.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Zero is returned if the operation was successful;
\-1 is returned if an error occurs, with a more specific
error code being placed in the global variable \fIerrno\fP.
