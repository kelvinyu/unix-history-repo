.SH NAME
write \- write on a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B write(fildes, buffer, nbytes)
.B char *buffer;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A file descriptor is a word returned from a
successful
.I open,
.I creat,
.I dup,
or
.IR pipe (2)
call.
.PP
.I Buffer
is the address of
.I nbytes
contiguous
bytes which are written on the output file.
The number of characters actually written is returned.
It should be regarded as an error
if this is not the same as requested.
.PP
Writes which are multiples
of 1024 characters long and begin on a 1024-byte boundary
in the file
are more efficient than any others.
.PP
.IR Write s
to the control terminal by a process
which is not in the process group of the termainl
and which is not ignoring or holding SIGTTOU signals
cause the writer's process group
to receive a SIGTTOU signal
(See
.IR jobs (3)
and the description of the LTOSTOP option in
.IR tty (4)
for details).
.PP
On some systems
.I write
clears the set-user-id bit on a file.
This prevents penetration of system security
by a user who
\*(lqcaptures\*(rq a writeable set-user-id file
owned by the super-user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
creat(2), open(2), pipe(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Returns
\-1 on error: bad descriptor, buffer address, or
count; physical I/O errors.
.SH "ASSEMBLER (PDP-11)"
(write = 4.)
.br
(file descriptor in r0)
.br
.B sys  write; buffer; nbytes
.br
(byte count in r0)
.SH BUGS
It would be nice to be able to call write and have the call return
with an error indication if there was no buffer space for the written
data, rather than blocking the process.
.PP
Processes which have been orphaned by their parents
and have been inherited by
.IR init (8)
never receive SIGTTOU signals.
Output by such a process
is permitted even when they are not in the process group
of the control terminal.
