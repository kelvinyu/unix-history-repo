.Sh NAME
.Nm unlink
.Nd remove directory entry
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn unlink "const char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn unlink
function
removes the link named by
.Fa path
from its directory and decrements the link count of the
file which was referenced by the link.
If that decrement reduces the link count of the file
to zero,
and no process has the file open, then
all resources associated with the file are reclaimed.
If one or more process have the file open when the last link is removed,
the link is removed, but the removal of the file is delayed until
all references to it have been closed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn unlink
succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width ENAMETOOLONGAA
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EINVAL

.It Bq Er EPERM
The directory containing the file is marked sticky,
and neither the containing directory nor the file to be removed
are owned by the effective user ID.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
