.ft B
symlink(name1, name2)
char *name1, *name2;

file created, \fIname1\fP is the string
used in creating the symbolic link).
Either name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not
be on the same file system.

Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.
If an error occurs, the error code is stored in \fIerrno\fP
and a \-1 value is returned.
