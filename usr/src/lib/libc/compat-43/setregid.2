.Sh NAME
.Nm setregid
.Nd set real and effective user ID's
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setregid "int rgid" "int egid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by:
.Ef
.Xr setegid 2 .
.Pp
The effective group ID's of the
current process is set according to the
.Fa egid
argument.
The real group ID's of the
current process is checked to ensure that it matches
either the real or saved ID of the process
(thus ensuring that it can later be restored to the effective ID).
If
.Fa egid
is -1, the current gid is filled in by the system.
If
.Fa rgid
is -1, the check on real ID above is skipped.
Unprivileged users may change the effective user
ID to the real user ID or the saved user ID;
only the super-user may make other changes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width [EPERM]
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id
or saved group-id was specified.
