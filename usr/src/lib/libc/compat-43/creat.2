.SH NAME
creat \- create a new file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B creat(name, mode)
.B char *name;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "This interface is obsoleted by open(2).
.PP
.I Creat
creates a new file or prepares to rewrite an existing
file called 
.IR name ,
given as the address of a null-terminated string.
If the file did not exist, it is given
mode
.IR mode ,
as modified by the process's mode mask (see
.IR umask (2)).
Also see
.IR  chmod (2)
for the
construction of the
.I mode
argument.
.PP
If the file did exist, its mode and owner remain unchanged
but it is truncated to 0 length.
.PP
The file is also opened for writing, and its file descriptor
is returned.
.SH NOTES
The
.I mode
given is arbitrary; it need not allow
writing.
This feature has been used in the past by
programs to construct a simple exclusive locking
mechanism.  It is replaced by the O_EXCL open
mode, or 
.IR flock (2)
facilitity.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
The value \-1 is returned if an error occurs.  Otherwise,
the call returns a non-negative descriptor which only permits
writing.
