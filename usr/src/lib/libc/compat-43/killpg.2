.Ft int
.Fn killpg "pid_t pgrp" "int sig"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Killpg
sends the signal
.Fa sig
to the process group
.Fa pgrp .
See

for a list of signals.

the sender must be the super-user.
As a single special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent
to any process that is a descendant of the current process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
