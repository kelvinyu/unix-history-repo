 * Quad arithmetic.
 *
 * This library makes the following assumptions:
 *
 *  - The type long long (aka quad) exists.
 *
 *  - A quad variable is exactly twice as long as `long'.
 *
 *  - The machine's arithmetic is two's complement.
 *
 * All other machine parameters are encapsulated here.  This library can
 * provide 128-bit arithmetic on a machine with 128-bit quads and 64-bit
 * longs, for instance, or 96-bit arithmetic on machines with 48-bit longs.
