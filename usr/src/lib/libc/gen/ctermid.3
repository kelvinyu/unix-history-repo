.SH NAME
ctermid \- generate terminal pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <stdio.h>
.sp
char *ctermid(char *buf);
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ctermid
function generates a string, that, when used as a pathname, refers to
the current controlling terminal for the current process.
.PP
If
.I buf
is a NULL pointer, a pointer to a static area is returned.
Otherwise, the pathname is copied into the memory referenced by
.IR buf .
.I Buf
is assumed to be at least L_ctermid (as defined in the include
file <stdio.h>) bytes long.
.PP
The current implementation simply returns ``/dev/tty''.
.SH RETURN
Upon successful completion, a non-NULL pointer is returned.
Otherwise, a NULL pointer is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The current implementation detects no error conditions.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ttyname(3)
.SH STANDARDS
.I Ctermid
conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').
.SH BUGS
By default, all information is contained in a static buffer which is
overwritten by each new call.
It must be copied elsewhere to be retained.
