The resulting group list is returned in the integer array pointed to by
.Fa groups .
The caller specifies the size of the 
.Fa groups
array in the integer pointed to by
.Fa ngroups ;
the actual number of groups found is returned in
.Fa ngroups .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getgrouplist
function
returns \-1 if the size of the group list is too small to
hold all the user's groups.
Here, the group array will be filled with as many groups as will fit.
