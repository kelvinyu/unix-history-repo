.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pstat
interprets the contents of certain system tables.
If
.I corefile
is given, the tables are sought there, otherwise
in
.I /dev/kmem.
The required namelist is taken from
.I /vmunix
unless 
.I system
is specified.
Options are
.TP \w'WCHAN\ 'u
.B \-a
Under
.BR \-p ,
describe all process slots rather than just active ones.

and free is given as well as the number of used pages which belong
to text images.
.PP
.B \-T
prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how full system tables have become if the
system is under heavy load.

It would be very useful if the system recorded \*(lqmaximum occupancy\*(rq
on the tables reported by
.B \-T;
even more useful if these tables were dynamically allocated.
