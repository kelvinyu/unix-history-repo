.PD
.TP
.B \-u
print information about a user process;
the next argument is its address as given
by
.IR ps (1).
The process must be in main memory, or the file used can
be a core image and the address 0.
.TP
.B \-f

.IR lseek (2).
.PD
.PP
.B \-s
print information about swap space usage: the number of (1k byte) pages used
and free is given as well as the number of used pages which belong
to text images.
.PP
.B \-T
prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how full system tables have become if the
system is under heavy load.
.B \-m
and
.B \-g
flags print the multiplexor tables.  These tables are rather difficult to
explain.  The potential explorer should examine the multiplexor code in
the system.

.SH BUGS
It would be very useful if the system recorded \*(lqmaximum occupancy\*(rq
on the tables reported by
.B \-T;
even more useful if these tables were dynamically allocated.
