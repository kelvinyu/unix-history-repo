.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quotaon
announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more
filesystems.
The filesystems specified must have entries in
.I /etc/fstab
and be mounted.
.I Quotaon
expects each filesystem to have quota files named
.I quota.user
and
.I quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.I /etc/fstab .
By default both user and group quotas are enabled.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas should be enabled.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas should be enabled.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
.PP
If the
.B \-a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.I quotaon
will enable all the filesystems indicated in
.I /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
are enabled.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
should be enabled.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
should be enabled.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
.PP
.I Quotaoff
announces to the system that the specified filesystems should have
any disk quotas turned off.
If the
.B \-a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.I quotaoff
will turn off quotas on all the filesystems indicated in
.I /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
The \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP flags work analogously with quotaon.
.PP
The \fI-v\fP flag causes
.I quotaon
and
.I quotaoff
to print a message for each filesystem where quotas are turned on or off.
