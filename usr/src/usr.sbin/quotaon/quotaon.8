.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quotaon
announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more
file systems.
The file systems specified must have entries in the
.I fstab
file and be mounted.
The file system quota files (named ``quotas'') must be present in
the root directory of the specified file system.
.PP
.I Quotaoff
announces to the system that the specified file systems should have
any disk quotas turned off.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
-v
Verbose; this flag causes
.I quotaon
and
.I quotaoff
to print a message for each file system where quotas are turned on or off.
.TP
-a
Turn on (off) quotas on the standard set of file systems.
This flag should be specified instead of a list of file systems.
It causes all file systems in the
.I fstab
file marked read-write with quotas to have their quotas turned on (off).
This is normally used at boot time by the
.I /etc/rc
file.
