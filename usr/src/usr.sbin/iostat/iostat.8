.SH NAME
iostat \- report I/O statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
iostat [ \-c count ] [ \-i interval ] [ drives ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Iostat
iteratively reports the number of characters read and written to terminals
per second, and, for each disk, the number of transfers per second,
kilobytes transferred per second, and the milliseconds per average seek.
It also gives the percentage of time the system has spent in user mode,
in user mode running low priority (niced) processes, in system mode, and
idling.
.PP
To compute this information, for each disk, seeks and data transfer
completions and number of words transferred are counted; for terminals
collectively, the number of input and output characters are counted.
Also, each sixtieth of a second, the state of each disk is examined and
a tally is made if the disk is active.
From these numbers and given the transfer rates of the devices it is
possible to determine average seek times for each device.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-c
Display the information
.I count
times.
The first dislpay is for all time since a reboot and each subsequent report
is for the time period since the last display.
.TP
\-i
Sleep
.I interval
seconds between each display of the information.
.PP
If more than 4 disk drives are configured in the system,
.I iostat
displays only the first 4 drives, with priority given to Massbus disk
drives (i.e. if both Unibus and Massbus drives are present and the total
number of drives exceeds 4, then some number of Unibus drives will not be
displayed in favor of the Massbus drives).
To force
.I iostat
to display specific drives, their names may be supplied on the command
line.
