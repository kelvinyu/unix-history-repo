.SH NAME
kgmon \- generate a dump of the operating system's profile buffers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/kgmon
[
.B \-b
] [
.B \-h
] [
.B \-r
] [
.B \-p
] [ system ] [ memory ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Kgmon
is a tool used when profiling the operating system.
When no arguments are supplied,
.I kgmon 
indicates the state of operating system profiling as running,
off, or not configured.
(see
.IR config (8))
If the
.B \-p
flag is specified,
.I kgmon
extracts profile data from the operating system and produces a
.I gmon.out
file suitable for later analysis by
.IR gprof (1).
.PP
The following options may be specified:
.TP
.B \-b
Resume the collection of profile data.
.TP
.B \-h
Stop the collection of profile data.
.TP
.B \-p
Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a
.I gmon.out
file.
.TP
.B \-r
Reset all the profile buffers. 
If the
.B \-p
flag is also specified, the
.I gmon.out
file is generated before the buffers are reset.
.PP
If neither 
.B \-b
nor
.B \-h
is specified, the state of profiling collection remains unchanged.
For example, if the
.B \-p
flag is specified and profile data is being collected,
profiling will be momentarily suspended,
the operating system profile buffers will be dumped,
and profiling will be immediately resumed.
.SH FILES
/vmunix \- the default system
.br
/dev/kmem \- the default memory
.SH "SEE ALSO"
gprof(1),
config(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Users with only read permission on /dev/kmem cannot change the state
of profiling collection. 
They can get a 
.I gmon.out
file with the warning that the data may be
inconsistent if profiling is in progress.
