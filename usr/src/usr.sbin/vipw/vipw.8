vipw \- edit the password file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vipw
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vipw
edits the password file while setting the appropriate locks,
and does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked.
If the password file is already being edited, then you will be told
to try again later.  The 
.I vi
editor will be used unless the environment variable EDITOR indicates
an alternate editor.  
.I Vipw
performs a number of consistency checks on the password entry for
.IR root ,
and will not allow a password file with a ``mangled'' root entry
to be installed.
