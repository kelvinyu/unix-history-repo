.SH NAME
vipw \- edit the password file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vipw
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vipw
locks the password file and makes a temporary copy of it for editing.
The user's editor (or by default, 
.IR vi (1))
is run on the copied file.
.PP
Once the file has been edited,
.I vipw
runs the program
.IR pwd_mkdb (8).
.I Pwd_mkdb
performs a number of consistency checks on the password entries, and will
not allow a password file with a ``mangled'' entry to be installed.
If
.I pwd_mkdb
rejects the new file, the user is prompted to re-enter the edit session.
Once the file is found to be satisfactory,
.I pwd_mkdb
installs it as the new password file.
.PP
If the password file is already locked, you will be told to try again
later.
