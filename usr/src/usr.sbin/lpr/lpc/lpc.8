.Nm lpc
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.Nm lpc
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
arguments as parameters to the command.  The standard input
may be redirected causing
.Nm lpc
to read commands from file.
Commands may be abreviated;
the following is the list of recognized commands.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic \&? No [ command ... ]
.It Ic help No [ command ... ]
Print a short description of each command specified in the argument list,
or, if no arguments are given, a list of the recognized commands.
.Pp
.It Ic abort  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
.Xr lpr )
for the specified printers.
.Pp
.It Ic clean  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Remove any temporary files, data files, and control files that cannot
be printed (i.e., do not form a complete printer job)
from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.
.Pp
.It Ic disable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Turn the specified printer queues off.  This prevents new
printer jobs from being entered into the queue by
.Xr lpr .
.Pp
.It Ic down No {\ all\ |\ printer\ } message ...
Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
.Em message

.Xr lpq 1
will indicate the printer is down and print the status message).
.Pp
.It Ic enable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Enable spooling on the local queue for the listed printers.
