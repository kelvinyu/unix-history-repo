The following are bugs or deficiencies in sendmail that I am aware of
but which have not been fixed in the current release.  You probably
want to get the most up to date version of this from FTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU
in /ucb/sendmail/KNOWNBUGS.

* "SYSERR: openmailer(local): fd 1 not open" message

  File descriptor 1 (standard output) should not be closed during normal
  processing.  This is checked periodically, and sometimes this condition
  is found and this message is produced.  Sendmail repairs the problem,
  and the mail is still delivered, but I still don't know why it happens.
  (There was a bug that was fixed in 8.6.beta.13 that might be related,
  but I think this bug still exists.)

* Null bytes are not handled properly.

  Sendmail should handle full binary data.  As it stands, it handles
  any value from 0x01-0xFF in the body and 0x01-0x80 and 0xA0-0xFF in
  the header.  Notably missing is 0x00, which would require a major
  restructuring of the code -- for example, almost no C library support
  could be used to handle strings.

* Route-addrs missing angle brackets.

  There are cases where route-addrs do not get angle brackets around them,
  such as in the "-r" flag on mailers or in the From_ line created when
  mailing to files.
