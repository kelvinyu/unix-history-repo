The following are bugs or deficiencies in sendmail that I am aware of
but which have not been fixed in the current release.  You probably
want to get the most up to date version of this from FTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU
in /ucb/sendmail/KNOWNBUGS.

* "SYSERR: openmailer(local): fd 1 not open" message

  File descriptor 1 (standard output) should not be closed during normal
  processing.  This is checked periodically, and sometimes this condition
  is found and this message is produced.  Sendmail repairs the problem,
  and the mail is still delivered, but I still don't know why it happens.
  (There was a bug that was fixed in 8.6.beta.13 that might be related,
  but I think this bug still exists.)

* Null bytes are not handled properly.

  Sendmail should handle full binary data.  As it stands, it handles
  any value from 0x01-0xFF in the body and 0x01-0x80 and 0xA0-0xFF in
  the header.  Notably missing is 0x00, which would require a major
  restructuring of the code -- for example, almost no C library support
  could be used to handle strings.

* Route-addrs missing angle brackets.

  There are cases where route-addrs do not get angle brackets around them,
  such as in the "-r" flag on mailers or in the From_ line created when
  mailing to files.

* Duplicate error messages.

  Sometimes identical, duplicate error messages can be generated.  As
  near as I can tell, this is rare and relatively innocuous.

* If you EXPN a list or user that has a program mailer, the output of
  EXPN will include ``@local.host.name''.  You can't actually mail to
  this address.  It's not clear what the right behaviour is in this
  circumstance.

* You can't use a ``mailer:relay.host'' for UUCP_RELAY or the relay
  host in the SITECONFIG macro (the second argument) in the
  configurations.  If the goal is to use ESMTP instead of SMTP,
  define `confRELAY_MAILER' to `esmtp' and use no mailer name.  Note
  that the default mailer used for relays (`relay') does use ESMTP
  by default (it didn't in prior releases).  This problem does not
  occur for other relays (BITNET or CSNET) or mailertable entries.
