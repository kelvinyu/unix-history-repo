/*
**  CONF.C -- Sendmail Configuration Tables.
**
**	Defines the configuration of this installation.
**
**	Compilation Flags:
**		V6 -- running on a version 6 system.  This determines
**			whether to define certain routines between
**			the two systems.  If you are running a funny
**			system, e.g., V6 with long tty names, this
**			should be checked carefully.
**
**	Configuration Variables:
**		HdrInfo -- a table describing well-known header fields.
**			Each entry has the field name and some flags,
**			which are described in sendmail.h.
**
**	Notes:
**		I have tried to put almost all the reasonable
**		configuration information into the configuration
**		file read at runtime.  My intent is that anything
**		here is a function of the version of UNIX you
**		are running, or is really static -- for example
**		the headers are a superset of widely used
**		protocols.  If you find yourself playing with
**		this file too much, you may be making a mistake!
