(Version 8.5 of %G%)

Key:
  X -- extension (user visible change)
  B -- bug fix
  S -- security fix
  E -- enhancement to existing algorithm

X ****	Database (keyed lookup) locking and rebuild.

X ****	8 -> 7 bit MIME conversion.

E ****	Change NoReturn to be an envelope flag. [8.7]

X ****	Add M_NOLOOPBACKCHK (k) mailer flag to turn off check of name in
	HELO command. [8.8]

X ****	Merge Sun changes.  [8.7]

X ****	Provide a way to turn off all DNS lookup in the I option, e.g.,
	``OIoff''.

E ***	Dynamically allocate MAXNAME buffers for headers.

X ***	Should have new mailer flags to override LocalMailer stuff:
	- M_ALIASABLE (A) -- can use as the LHS of an alias.
	- M_HASPWENT (w) -- should have a /etc/passwd entry.  If not found
	  there, implies user unknown.  Also implies .forward and UDB
	  searching, search for |, /, and :include:, etc.).
	- Actually, UDB searching and |, /, and :include: mapping should
	  probably be on another flag.  (Cannot be 'l' for back compat
	  reasons.)
	- Need for $@host part of triple and Return-Receipt-To: processing
	  should also be split apart.
	[8.8]

X ***	Add ability to disable Return-Receipt-To: on a privacy flag. [8.8]

X **	Handle Expires: header field (if still in queue).

X **	Find a good test suite and include in the distribution.

S **	[AEJ] You can use symbolic links to point into protected directories.

X **	Extend OI to allow separate settings for canonification, MX, and A
	lookups. [8.8?]

X **	Add $!x class to match any number of words not in class x [KRE].

X **	LOCAL_RULE_5 (Spencer Sun, spencer@phoenix.Princeton.EDU)

X **	Add "null" map -- no transformation, always returns TRUE, to
	allow you to break $&x into tokens.  Could be related to dequote.
	[8.7?]

X **	Add "bestmx" map -- returns "best MX host" for this address.
	Allows you to do automatic detection of when you are the best
	MX for a given address.  [8.7?]

E *	Don't send ErrMsgFile to postmaster bounces.  (Josh Smith,
	josh@osiris.ac.hmc.edu).

X *	WIN/3B support (non-atomic rename, no h_addr_list, others?)
	(Bruce Lilly <blilly!bruce@uu.psi.com>)

X *	Sun YBTS daemon uses -ba.  [Martin Kiff <MGK@newton.npl.co.uk>]

B *	EXPN adds @domain to all mailers, including prog.  Is this right?
	[Bob Henry]

B *	EXPN adds @localhost instead of @$M.  [Pel Emanuelsson]

E *	Change body put code to time out around individual puts.  This will
	make the timeout algorithm more responsive and more resilient.
	Unfortunately, it's also a pain in the butt.

X *	Some way to relay unfound local users to another site.

X *	Disable all default RW sets except mailer-specific?
