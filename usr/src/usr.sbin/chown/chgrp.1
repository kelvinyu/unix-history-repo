.Sh NAME
.Nm chgrp
.Nd change group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chgrp
.Op Fl HRfh
.Ar group
.Ar files ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each
.Ar file
operand to the
.Ar group
ID specified by the group operand.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.  All other
symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not followed.
.It Fl R
Recursively change file group IDs.
For each
.Ar file
operand that names a directory, chgrp changes the
group of the directory and all files in the file
hierarchy below it.
When symbolic links are encountered, their group is changed,
but they are not traversed.
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and doesn't
query about strange modes (unless the user does not have proper permissions).
.It Fl h
When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, follow it.
.El
.Pp
The group of a symbolic link is immutable, so unless the 
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
flag is set,
.Nm chgrp
on a symbolic link is a no-op.
.Pp
Operands:
.Bl -tag -width group
.It Ar group
The
.Ar group
can be either a group name from the group database, or a numeric
group ID.
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file whose group ID is to be modified.
.El
.Pp
The user invoking
must belong
to the specified group and be the owner of the file, or be the super-user.
.Pp
The
.Nm chgrp
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
