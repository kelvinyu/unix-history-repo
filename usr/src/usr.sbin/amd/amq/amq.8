.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Amq
provides a simple way of determining the current state of the
.Xr amd 8
program.
Communication is by
.Tn RPC .
Three modes of operation are supported by the current protocol.
By default a list of mount points and auto-mounted filesystems
is output.
An alternative host can be specified using the
.Fl h
option.
.Pp
If directory names are given, as output by default,
then per-filesystem information is displayed.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Request automounter to flush the internal caches.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Query alternate host
.Ar hostname .
By default the local host is used.  In an
.Tn HP-UX
cluster, the root server is queried by default, since
that is the system on which the automounter is normally run.
.It Fl m
Request the automounter to provide a list of mounted filesystems,
including the number of references to each filesystem and any error
which occured while mounting.
.It Fl s
Request the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.
.It Fl u
Request the automounter to unmount the named filesystems
instead of providing information about them.  Unmounts are requested,
not forced.  They merely cause the mounted filesystem to timeout,
which will be picked up by
.Xr amd Ns \'s
main scheduler thus causing the normal timeout action to be taken.
.It Fl v
Request the automounter to provide version information.  This is a subset
of the information provided by
.Xr amd Ns \'s
.It Fl v
option.
.It Fl M
Request automounter to add the given map entry to the root map and then
trigger a mount request for it.
