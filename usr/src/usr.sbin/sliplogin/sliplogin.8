.SH NAME
sliplogin \- attach a serial line network interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sliplogin
[ {
.I loginname
|
.I local
.I remote
[
.I mask
] } ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sliplogin
is used to turn the terminal line on the standard input of the process into
a Serial Line IP link to a remote host.  In order to do this, the program
needs to know the local interface address of the link, the remote interface
address, and the applicable (sub)net mask.  There are three ways it may
determine this information:
.IP -
If run by a non-root user id, the program will ignore any arguments and
instead search a table (the
.B /etc/hosts.slip
file) for an entry matching that user id's login name, and set the parameters
it needs from the contents of the matching entry.  This would be the typical
usage when sliplogin is the shell for a remote site connecting via dialup
SLIP.
.IP -
If run by root with a single argument, the described search procedure will
be performed using the argument as a key.
.IP -
If run by root with two or three arguments, they are assumed to set the
needed parameters explicitly.  A missing
.I mask
will cause the default network mask for that class network to be used.
.PP
The parameters may be specified either by name (which will be looked up
using
.BR gethostbyname (3N)
and
.BR getnetbyname (3N)),
or as a dotted quad that the
.BR inet_addr (3N)
function can interpret.
.PP
The line speed is unchanged, but other terminal line parameters are
initialized properly for the purpose.
.PP
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.  The interface is
automatically detached when the
.B sliplogin
process dies.  If the kernel
.B slip
module has been configured for it, all routes through that interface will
also disappear at the same time.
.SH "TABLE FORMAT"
The format of the
.B /etc/hosts.slip
file is as follows:
.IP -
blank lines and lines with a leading # are ignored.
.IP -
all other lines should have the form:
.sp
.br
\fIname mode local-address remote-address netmask\fP
.br
.sp
The
.I name
is usually the login name of a remote host that wishes to connect by
dialup slip.  More generally it is any key you wish for the address
and mask parameters specified on that line.  The
.I mode
is currently unused but must be specified.  Use
.BR normal .
The remaining parameters have been discussed.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.B sliplogin
logs various information to the system log daemon,
.BR syslogd (8),
with a facility code of
.BR daemon .
