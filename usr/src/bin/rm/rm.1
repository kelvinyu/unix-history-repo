.Nm rm
.Op Fl f Li \&| Fl i

.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rm
utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on the
command line.
If the permissions of the file do not permit writing, and the standard
input device is a terminal, the user is prompted for confirmation.

The following options are available:
.Tw 8n
.Tp Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.Tp Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i 
options.
.Tp Fl i
Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of
the file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device is a
terminal.
The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f 
options.
.Tp Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
The 
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before 
each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt
is made to remove the directory).
If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in
that directory is skipped.
