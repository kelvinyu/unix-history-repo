.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ps
displays a header line followed by lines containing information about your
processes that have controlling terminals.
This information is sorted by process ID.
.PP
The information displayed is selected based on a set of keywords (see the
\-L, \-O and \-o options).
The default output format includes, for each process, the process' ID,
controlling terminal, cpu time (including both user and system time),
state, and associated command.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-a
Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.
.TP
\-C
Change the way the cpu percentage is calculated by using a ``raw''
cpu calculation that ignores ``resident'' time (this normally has
no effect).
.TP
\-h
Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee one
header per page of information.
.TP
\-j
Print information associated with the following keywords:
user, pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time and command.
.TP
\-L
List the set of available keywords.
If the \-L option is specified more than once,
.I ps
will display a long listing of the keywords and their meanings.
.TP
\-l
Display information associated with the following keywords:
uid, pid, ppid, cpu, pri, nice, vsz, rss, wchan, state, tt, time
and command.
.TP
\-m
Sort by memory usage, instead of by process ID.
.TP
\-O
Add the information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specifed, after the process ID, in the default information
display.
Keywords may be appended with an equals (``='') sign and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.TP
\-o
Display information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specifed.
Keywords may be appended with an equals (``='') sign and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.TP
\-p
Display information associated with the specified process ID.
.TP
\-r
Sort by current cpu usage, instead of by process ID.
.TP
\-S
Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited
children to their parent process.
.TP
\-s
Display information associated with the following keywords:
uid, pid, sig, sigmask, sigignore, sigcatch, state, tt and command.
.TP
\-T
Display information about processes attached to the device associated
with the standard input.
.TP
\-t
Display information about processes attached to the specified terminal
device.
.TP
\-u
Display information associated with the following keywords:
user, pid, %cpu, %mem, vsz, rss, tt, state, start, time and command.
The \-u option implies the \-r option.
.TP
\-v
Display information associated with the following keywords:
pid, tt, state, time, sl, re, pagein, vsz, rss, lim, tsiz, trs,
%cpu, %mem and command.
The \-v option implies the \-m option.
.TP
\-w
Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default which
is your window size.
If the \-w option is specified more than once,
.I ps
will use as many columns as necessary without regard for your window size.
.TP
\-x
Display information about processes without controlling terminals.
.PP
Three additional arguments may be specified.
The first additional argument is the file to read for the system namelist
(instead of the default ``/vmunix'').
The second additional argument is a core file to use for kernel memory
(instead of the default ``/dev/mem'').
The third addition argument is a file to be used for swap
(instead of the default ``/dev/swap'').
.PP
A complete list of the available keywords are listed below.
Some of these keywords are further specifed as follows:
.TP
%cpu
The cpu utilization of the process; this is a decaying average over up to
a minute of previous (real) time.
Since the time base over which this is computed varies (since processes may
be very young) it is possible for the sum of all %CPU fields to exceed 100%.
.TP
%mem
The percentage of real memory used by this process.
.TP
flags
The flags (in hexadecimal) associated with the process as in
the include file ``sys/proc.h'':

.fi
.RE
.TP
lim
The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
.IR setrlimit (2).
.TP
lstart
The exact time the command started, using the ``%C'' format described in
.IR strftime (3).
.TP
nice
The process scheduling increment (see
.IR setpriority (2)).
.TP
rss
the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte units).
.TP
start
The time the command started.
If the command started less than 24 hours ago, the start time is
displayed using the ``%l:ps.1p'' format described in 
.IR strftime (3).
If the command started less than 7 days ago, the start time is
displayed using the ``%a6.11p'' format.
Otherwise, the start time is displayed using the ``%e%b%y'' format.
.TP
state
The state is given by a sequence of letters, e.g., ``RWNA''.
The first letter indicates the run state of the process:
.sp
.PD 0
.RS
.IP D
Marks a process in disk (or other short term, uninterruptable) wait.
.IP I
Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).
.IP P
Marks a process in page wait.
.IP R
Marks a runnable process.
.IP S
Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.
.IP T
Marks a stopped process.
.IP Z
Marks a dead process (a ``zombie'').
.sp
.PP
Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional state
information:
.sp
.IP +
The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.
.IP <
The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
.IP >
The process has specified a soft limit on memory requirements and is
currently exceeding that limit; such a process is (necessarily) not
swapped.
.IP A
the process has asked for random page replacement (VA_ANOM, from
.IR vadvise (2),
e.g.,
.IR lisp (1)
in a garbage collect).
.IP E
The process is trying to exit.
.IP L
The process has pages locked in core (e.g., for raw I/O).
.IP N
The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
.IR setpriority (2)).
.IP S
The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL, from
.IR vadvise (2),
e.g., a large image processing program using virtual memory to
sequentially address voluminous data).
.IP s
The process is a session leader.
.IP V
The process is suspended during a vfork.
.IP W
The process is swapped out.
.IP X
The process is being traced or debugged.
.RE
.PD
.TP
tt
An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if any.
The abbreviation consists of the two letters following ``/dev/tty'',
or, for the console, ``co''.
This is followed by a ``-'' if the process can no longer reach that
controlling terminal (i.e., it has been revoked).
.TP
wchan
The event on which the process is waiting (an address in the system).
When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, e.g., 0x80324000 prints
as 324000.
.PP
When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (i.e., a zombie)
is listed as ``<defunct>'', and a process which is blocked while trying
to exit is listed as ``<exiting>''.
.B Ps
makes an educated guess as to the file name and arguments given when the
process was created by examining memory or the swap area.
The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in any event a process
is entitled to destroy this information, so the names cannot be depended
on too much.
The ucomm (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
