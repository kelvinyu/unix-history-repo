# This file lists all the builtin commands.  The first column is the name
# of a C routine.  The -j flag, if present, specifies that this command
# is to be excluded from systems without job control.  The rest of the line
# specifies the command name or names used to run the command.  The entry
# for bltincmd, which is run when the user does not specify a command, must
# come first.
