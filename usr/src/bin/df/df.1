.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl ikn
.Op Ar file | Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Df
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar filesystem
or on the filesystem of which
.Ar file
is a part.
If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl n
flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
