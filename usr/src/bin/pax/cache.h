/*
 * Constants and data structures used to implement group and password file
 * caches. Traditional passwd/group cache routines perform quite poorly with
 * archives. The chances of hitting a valid lookup with an archive is quite a
 * bit worse than with files already resident on the file system. These misses
 * create a MAJOR performance cost. To adress this problem, these routines
 * cache both hits and misses.
 *
 * NOTE:  name lengths must be as large as those stored in ANY PROTOCOL and
 * as stored in the passwd and group files. CACHE SIZES MUST BE PRIME
