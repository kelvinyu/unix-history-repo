DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s file contains information regarding the known
     protocols used in the DARPA Internet.  For each protocol a
     single line should be present with the following informa-
     tion:

     official protocol name
     protocol number
     aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab char-
     acters.  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; char-
     acters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by rou-
     tines which search the file.

     Protocol names may contain any printable character other
     than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
