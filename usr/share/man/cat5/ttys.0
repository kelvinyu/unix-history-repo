     ttys - terminal initialization data

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _t_t_y_s file contains information that is used by various
     routines to initialize and control the use of terminal spe-
     cial files.  This information is read with the _g_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t(3)
     library routines.	There is one line in the _t_t_y_s file per
     special file.  Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
     Fields comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in
     double quotes (``"'').  Blank lines and comments may appear
     anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash marks
     (``#'') and new lines.  Any unspecified fields will default
     to null.

     The first field is the terminal's entry in the device direc-
     tory, ``/dev''.

     The second field of the file is the command to execute for
     the line, typically _g_e_t_t_y(8), which performs such tasks as
     baud-rate recognition, reading the login name, and calling
     _l_o_g_i_n(1).	It can be, however, any desired command, for
     example the start up for a window system terminal emulator
     or some other daemon process, and can contain multiple words
     if quoted.

     The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to
     that tty line, normally the one found in the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data
     base file.  The environmental variable ``TERM'' is initial-
     ized with the value by either _g_e_t_t_y(8) or _l_o_g_i_n(1).

     The remaining fields set flags in the _t_y__s_t_a_t_u_s entry (see
     _g_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t(3)) or specify a window system process that
     _i_n_i_t(8) will maintain for the terminal line.

     As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that
     _i_n_i_t should (should not) execute the command given in the
     second field, while ``secure'' (if ``on'' is also specified)
     allows users with a uid of 0 to login on this line.  These
     flag fields should not be quoted.

     The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command
     string which _i_n_i_t will execute bbeeffoorree starting the command
     specified by the second field.
