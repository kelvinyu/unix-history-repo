       cchhiinngg [ hexagram ]

       The  _I _C_h_i_n_g or _B_o_o_k _o_f _C_h_a_n_g_e_s is an ancient Chinese ora-
       cle that has been in use for centuries as a source of wis-
       dom and advice.

       The text of the _o_r_a_c_l_e (as it is sometimes known) consists
       of sixty-four _h_e_x_a_g_r_a_m_s_, each symbolized by  a  particular
       arrangement  of six straight (---) and broken (- -) lines.
       These lines have values ranging  from  six  through  nine,
       with the even values indicating the broken lines.

       Each  hexagram consists of two major sections.  The JJuuddggee--
       mmeenntt relates specifically to the matter at hand (E.g., "It
       furthers  one  to  have somewhere to go.") while the IImmaaggee
       describes the general attributes of the hexagram  and  how
       they apply to one's own life ("Thus the superior man makes
       himself strong and untiring.").

       When any of the lines have the values six  or  nine,  they
       are  moving lines; for each there is an appended judgement
       which becomes significant.  Furthermore, the moving  lines
       are inherently unstable and change into their opposites; a
       second hexagram (and  thus  an  additional  judgement)  is
       formed.

       Normally,  one  consults  the oracle by fixing the desired
       question firmly in mind and then casting a set of  changes
       (lines)  using yarrow-stalks or tossed coins.  The result-
       ing hexagram will be the answer to the question.

       Using an algorithm suggested by S. C.  Johnson,  the  UNIX
       _o_r_a_c_l_e simply reads a question from the standard input (up
       to an EOF) and hashes the individual characters in  combi-
       nation  with  the  time  of  day, process id and any other
       magic numbers which happen to be lying around the  system.
       The resulting value is used as the seed of a random number
       generator which drives a simulated  coin-toss  divination.
       The  answer is then piped through nnrrooffff for formatting and
       will appear on the standard output.

       For those who wish to remain steadfast in the  old  tradi-
       tions,  the  oracle will also accept the results of a per-
       sonal divination using, for example, coins.  To  do  this,
       cast the change and then type the resulting line values as
       an argument.
