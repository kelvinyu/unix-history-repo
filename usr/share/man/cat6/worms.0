DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Brian Horn (cithep!bdh) showed me a _T_O_P_S-_2_0 program  on  the
     DEC-2136  machine	called _W_O_R_M, and suggested that I write a
     similar program that would run under _U_n_i_x.  I  did,  and  no
     apologies.

     The options are as follows:

     -_f   makes a ``field'' for the worm(s) to eat.

     -_t   causes each worm to leave a trail behind it.

     You can figure out the rest by yourself.

     properly on a terminal that wraps at the right margin.
