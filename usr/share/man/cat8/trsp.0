     _T_r_p_t interrogates the buffer of SPP trace records created
     when a socket is marked for "debugging" (see _s_e_t_s_o_c_k_o_p_t(2)),
     and prints a readable description of these records.  When no
     options are supplied, _t_r_s_p prints all the trace records
     found in the system grouped according to SPP connection pro-
     tocol control block (PCB).  The following options may be
     used to alter this behavior.

     --ss   in addition to the normal output, print a detailed
	  description of the packet sequencing information,

     --tt   in addition to the normal output, print the values for
	  all timers at each point in the trace,

     --jj   just give a list of the protocol control block
	  addresses for which there are trace records,

     --pp   show only trace records associated with the protocol
	  control block who's address follows,

     --aa   in addition to the normal output, print the values of
	  the source and destination addresses for each packet
	  recorded.

     The recommended use of _t_r_s_p is as follows.  Isolate the
     problem and enable debugging on the socket(s) involved in
     the connection.  Find the address of the protocol control
     blocks associated with the sockets using the --AA option to
     _n_e_t_s_t_a_t(1).  Then run _t_r_s_p with the --pp option, supplying the
     associated protocol control block addresses.  If there are
     many sockets using the debugging option, the --jj option may
     be useful in checking to see if any trace records are
     present for the socket in question.

     If debugging is being performed on a system or core file
     other than the default, the last two arguments may be used
     to supplant the defaults.

     proper symbols to find the trace buffer; others which should

     Should also print the data for each input or output, but
     this is not saved in the race record.

     The output format is inscrutable and should be described
     here.
