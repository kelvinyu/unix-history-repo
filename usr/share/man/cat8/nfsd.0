     NNffssdd runs on a server machine to service NFS requests from client ma-
     chines.  At least one nnffssdd must be running for a machine to operate as a
     server.  The options --uu and --tt are used to indicate which transport pro-
     tocols are to be served.

     Options available to nnffssdd:

     --rr      Register the NFS service with portmap(8) without creating any
             servers. This option can be used along with the --uu or --tt options
             to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.

     --tt      Serve TCP NFS clients.

     --uu      Serve UDP NFS clients.

     _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s
             Specifies how many servers to fork off.

     If neither --uu or --tt are specified, _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s servers for UDP transport are
     started. (compatibility) If _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s is not specified, it defaults to 4.

     For example:

     nfsd -u -t 6

           Serves UDP and TCP transports using 6 daemons in the kernel.

           A server should typically run enough daemons to handle the maximum
           level of concurrency from its clients, typically four to six.

           NNffssdd listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS
           server specification; see _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
