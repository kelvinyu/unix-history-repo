     _N_f_s_d runs on a server machine to service NFS requests from
     client machines.  At least one _n_f_s_d must be running for a
     machine to operate as a server.  The options --uu and --tt are
     used to indicate which transport protocols are to be served.

     --uu   Serve UDP NFS clients.

     --tt   Serve TCP NFS clients.

     _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h
	  These arguments permit restriction of NFS services to a
	  subset of the host addresses. The _m_s_k and _m_t_c_h are
	  applied to the client host address as follows:

	  if (( _h_o_s_t__a_d_d_r_e_s_s & _m_s_k ) == _m_t_c_h )
	     - service the client request
	  else
	     - drop the request

     _h_o_s_t_a_d_r_1,...
	  You may also specify zero or more specific host
	  addresses to be accepted as well as ones that pass the
	  _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h test above.  This may only be done for tran-
	  sport protocols that are connection based, such as TCP.
	  For the internet domain, _m_s_k, _m_t_c_h and _h_o_s_t_a_d_r_s' are
	  specified in internet _d_o_t notation.

     _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s
	  Specifies how many servers to fork off. This may only
	  be specified for non-connection based protocols such as
	  UDP.

     If neither -_u or -_t are specified, _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s servers for UDP
     accepting requests from all clients are started.  If
     _n_u_m_p_r_o_c_s is not specified, it defaults to 1.

     For example:

     nfsd -u 255.255.255.0,131.104.48.0,4 -t
     255.255.0.0,131.104.0.0,131.102.31.2

     -	  Serves UDP and TCP transports. For UDP, it runs 4 dae-
	  mons that accept requests from any client on subnet
	  131.104.48.  For TCP, it accepts connections from any

	  client on network 131.104 plus the client with the
	  address 131.102.31.2.

     nfsd -u 255.255.240.0,131.104.0.0,6 -t 0,0

     -	  Serves UDP and TCP transports.  For UDP, it runs 6 dae-
	  mons that accept requests from clients with addresses
	  in the range 131.104.0.x - 131.104.15.x.  For TCP, it
	  accepts connections from any client.

     nfsd -u 0,0,4

     -	  Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only.

     nfsd 4

     -	  Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only. (Compati-
	  bility)

     A server should typically run enough daemons to handle the
     maximum level of concurrency from its clients, typically
     four to six.

     _N_f_s_d listens for service requests at the port indicated in
     the NFS server specification; see ``Network File System Pro-
     tocol Specification, RFC1094''
