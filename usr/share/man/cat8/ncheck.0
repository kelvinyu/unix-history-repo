       NN..BB..::  For  most normal file system maintenance, the func-
       tion of _n_c_h_e_c_k is subsumed by _f_s_c_k(8).

       _N_c_h_e_c_k with no options generates a pathname  vs.  i-number
       list of all files on every specified filesystem.  Names of
       directory files are  followed  by  `/..'.   The  --ii  option
       reduces  the  report  to  only those files whose i-numbers
       follow.  The --aa option allows printing of  the  names  `..'
       and  `....', which are ordinarily suppressed.  The --ss option
       reduces the report to special files and  files  with  set-
       user-ID  mode; it is intended to discover concealed viola-
       tions of security policy.

       The report is in no useful order, and probably  should  be
       sorted.

       When  the  filesystem  structure is improper, `??' denotes
       the `parent' of a parentless file and a pathname beginning
       with `...' denotes a loop.
