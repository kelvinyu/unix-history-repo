     _S_h_u_t_d_o_w_n provides an automated shutdown procedure which a
     super-user can use to notify users nicely when the system is
     shutting down, saving them from system administrators, hack-
     ers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother with such
     niceties.

     _T_i_m_e is the time at which _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n will bring the system
     down and may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shut-
     down) or specify a future time in one of two formats:
     +_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m, where the year, month, and day may
     be defaulted to the current system values.  The first form
     brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r minutes and the second at
     the absolute time specified.

     Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is
     broadcast to users currently logged into the system; if a
     single dash (``-'') is supplied as an option, the warning
     message is read from the standard input.

     At intervals, which get closer together as apocalypse
     approaches, starting at ten hours before shutdown, warning
     messages are displayed at the terminals of all users on the
     system.  Five minutes before shutdown, or immediately if
     shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by
     creating /_e_t_c/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and copying the warning message there.
     If this file exists when a user attempts to log in, _l_o_g_i_n(1)
     prints its contents and exits.  The file is removed just
     before _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n exits.

     At shutdown time a message is written in the system log,
     containing the time of shutdown, who ran shutdown and the
     reason.  Then a terminate signal is sent to _i_n_i_t to bring
     the system down to single-user state.  Alternatively, if --rr,,
     --hh,, or --kk is used, then _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n will exec _r_e_b_o_o_t(8),
     _h_a_l_t(8), or avoid shutting the system down (respectively).
     (If it isn't obvious, --kk is to make people _t_h_i_n_k the system
     is going down!)

     With the --ff option, _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n arranges, in the manner of
     _f_a_s_t_b_o_o_t(8), that when the system is rebooted the file sys-
     tems will not be checked.	The --nn option prevents the normal
     _s_y_n_c(2) before stopping.

     The time of the shutdown and the warning message are placed
     in /_e_t_c/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and should be used to inform the users about
