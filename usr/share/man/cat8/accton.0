       With an argument naming an existing  _f_i_l_e_,  _a_c_c_t_o_n  causes
       system  accounting  information for every process executed
       to be placed at the end of the file.  If  no  argument  is
       given, accounting is turned off.

       _S_a reports on, cleans up, and generally maintains account-
       ing files.

       _S_a   is   able   to   condense    the    information    in
       _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t into a summary file _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t
       which contains a count of the number of times each command
       was  called and the time resources consumed.  This conden-
       sation  is   desirable   because   on   a   large   system
       _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t  can  grow  by  100 blocks per day.  The
       summary file is normally read before the accounting  file,
       so the reports include all available information.

       If  a  file  name is given as the last argument, that file
       will be treated as the accounting file;  _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_a_c_c_t
       is the default.

       Output   fields   are   labeled:  "cpu"  for  the  sum  of
       user+system time (in minutes), "re" for real time (also in
       minutes),  "k"  for  cpu-time  averaged  core usage (in 1k
       units), "avio" for average number of  i/o  operations  per
       execution.   With  options  fields labeled "tio" for total
       i/o operations, "k*sec" for cpu  storage  integral  (kilo-
       core  seconds),  "u"  and "s" for user and system cpu time
       alone (both in minutes) will sometimes appear.

       There are near a googol of options:


       a      Print all  command  names,  even  those  containing
              unprintable  characters  and  those used only once.
              By  default,  those  are  placed  under  the   name
              `***other.'

       b      Sort  output by sum of user and system time divided
              by number of calls.  Default sort is by sum of user
              and system times.

       c      Besides  total user, system, and real time for each
              command print percentage of  total  time  over  all
              commands.

       d      Sort by average number of disk i/o operations.

       D      Print  and  sort by total number of disk i/o opera-
              tions.

       f      Force no interactive threshold compression with  -v
              flag.

       i      Don't read in summary file.

       j      Instead  of  total  minutes time for each category,
              give seconds per call.

       k      Sort by cpu-time average memory usage.

       K      Print and sort by cpu-storage integral.

       l      Separate system and user time;  normally  they  are
              combined.

       m      Print number of processes and number of CPU minutes
              for each user.

       n      Sort by number of calls.

       r      Reverse order of sort.

       s      Merge   accounting   file   into    summary    file
              _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t when done.

       t      For  each  command report ratio of real time to the
              sum of user and system times.

       u      Superseding all other flags, print for each command
              in  the  accounting  file  the  user ID and command
              name.

       v      Followed by a number _n_, types the name of each com-
              mand used _n times or fewer.  Await a reply from the
              terminal; if it begins with `y', add the command to
              the  category `**junk**.' This is used to strip out
              garbage.

       S      The following filename is used as the command  sum-
              mary file instead of _/_v_a_r_/_a_c_c_o_u_n_t_/_s_a_v_a_c_c_t_.

       U      The   following   filename   is   used  instead  of
