     _R_o_u_t_e is a program used to manually manipulate the network
     routing tables.  It normally is not needed, as the system
     routing table management daemon, _r_o_u_t_e_d(8C), should tend to
     this task.

     _R_o_u_t_e accepts five commands: _a_d_d, to add a route, _f_l_u_s_h, to
     remove all routes, _d_e_l_e_t_e, to delete a specific route,
     _c_h_a_n_g_e, to changes aspects of a route (such as its gateway),
     and _m_o_n_i_t_o_r, to report any changes to the routing informa-
     tion base, routing lookup misses, or suspected network par-
     tionings.

     The monitor command has the syntax
       rroouuttee [ --nn ] mmoonniittoorr

     The flush command has the syntax
       rroouuttee [ --nn ] [ --nn ] fflluusshh [ _f_a_m_i_l_y ]

     where the address family may be specified by any of the --
     oossii, --xxnnss, or --iinneett keywords.

     The other commands have the following syntax:

       rroouuttee [ -_n ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ --nneett | --hhoosstt ] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_-
     _w_a_y is the next-hop gateway to which packets should be
     addressed.  Routes to a particular host are distinguished
     from those to a network by interpreting the Internet address
     associated with _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  The optional keywords --nneett and
     --hhoosstt force the destination to be interpreted as a network
     or a host, respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has
     a ``local address part'' of INADDR_ANY, or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_-
     _t_i_o_n is the symbolic name of a network, then the route is
     assumed to be to a network; otherwise, it is presumed to be
     a route to a host.

     For example, 128.32 is interpreted as -_h_o_s_t 128.0.0.32,
     128.32.130 is interpreted as -_h_o_s_t 128.32.0.130; -_n_e_t _1_2_8._3_2
     is interpreted as 128.32.0.0, and -_n_e_t _1_2_8._3_2._1_3_0 is inter-
     preted as 128.32.130.0.

     If the route is via an interface rather than via a gateway,
     the -_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e modifier should be specified; the gateway
     given is the address of this host on the common network,

     indicating the interface to be used for transmission.

     The optional modifiers -_x_n_s, and -_o_s_i specify that all sub-
     sequent addresses are in the XNS or OSI address families,
     and the names must be numeric specifications rather than
     symbolic names.

     The optional -_n_e_t_m_a_s_k qualifier is intended to acheieve the
     effect of an OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option.  One
     specifies an additional ensuing address parameter (to be
     interpreted as a network mask).  One can override the impli-
     cit network mask generated in the inet case by making sure
     this option follows the destination parameter.

     The optional modifiers -_r_t_t, -_r_t_t_v_a_r, -_s_e_n_d_p_i_p_e, -_r_e_c_v_p_i_p_e,
     -_m_t_u, -_h_o_p_c_o_u_n_t, -_e_x_p_i_r_e, and -_s_s_t_h_r_e_s_h provide initial
     values to metrics maintained in the routing entry.  These
     may be individually locked by preceding each such modifier
     to be locked by the -_l_o_c_k meta-modifier, or one can specify
     that all ensuing metrics may be locked by the -_l_o_c_k_r_e_s_t
     meta-modifier.

     All symbolic names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y
     are looked up first as a host name using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N).
     If this lookup fails, _g_e_t_n_e_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N) is then used to
     interpret the name as that of a network.

     _R_o_u_t_e uses a routing socket and the new message types
     RTM_ADD, RTM_DELETE, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the
     super-user may modify the routing tables.

     If the fflluusshh command is specified, _r_o_u_t_e will ``flush'' the
     routing tables of all gateway entries.  One can choose to
     flush only those routes whose destinations are of a given
     address family, by specifying an optional keyword describing
     which address family.

     The --nn option prevents attempts to print host and network
     names symbolically when reporting actions.  The --vv option
     causes additional details to be printed.  The --qq option
     supresses all output.

     The specified route is being added to the tables.	The
     values printed are from the routing table entry supplied in

     primary address of the gateway (the first one returned by
     _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e), the gateway address is printed numerically
     as well as symbolically.
