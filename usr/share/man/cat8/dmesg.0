     NN..BB..:: _D_m_e_s_g is obsoleted by _s_y_s_l_o_g_d(8) for maintenance of
     the system error log.

     _D_m_e_s_g looks in a system buffer for recently printed diagnos-
     tic messages and prints them on the standard output.  The
     messages are those printed or logged by the system when
     errors occur.  If the -- flag is given, then _d_m_e_s_g computes
     (incrementally) the new messages since the last time it was
     run and places these on the standard output.
