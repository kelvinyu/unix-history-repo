     Note: This is the old version 7 UNIX system mail program.	The default
     mmaaiill command is described in Mail(1).

     MMaaiill with no argument prints a user's mail, message-by-message, in last-
     in, first-out order; the optional argument ++ displays the mail messages
     in first-in, first-out order.  For each message, it reads a line from the
     standard input to direct disposition of the message.

     newline   Go on to next message.

     dd	       Delete message and go on to the next.

     pp	       Print message again.

     --	       Go back to previous message.

     ss[_f_i_l_e]...
	       Save the message in the named _f_i_l_e_s (`mbox' default).

     ww[_f_i_l_e]...
	       Save the message, without a header, in the named _f_i_l_e_s, _m_b_o_x is
	       the default.

     mm[_p_e_r_s_o_n]...
	       Mail the message to the named _p_e_r_s_o_n_s (yourself is default).

     EOT       (control-D) Put unexamined mail back in the mailbox and stop.

     qq	       Same as EOT.

     !!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	       Escape to the Shell to do _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     **	       Print a command summary.

     An interrupt normally terminates the _m_a_i_l command; the mail file is un-
     changed.  The optional argument --ii tells _m_a_i_l to continue after inter-
     rupts.

     When _p_e_r_s_o_n_s are named, _m_a_i_l takes the standard input up to an end-of-
     file (or a line with just `.') and adds it to each _p_e_r_s_o_n's _m_a_i_l file.
     The message is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.  Lines that
     look like postmarks are prepended with `>'.  A _p_e_r_s_o_n is usually a user
     name recognized by login(1).  To denote a recipient on a remote system,
     prefix _p_e_r_s_o_n by the system name and exclamation mark (see uucp(1)).

     The --ff option causes the named file, for example, _m_b_o_x, to be printed as
     if it were the mail file.

     When a user logs in he is informed of the presence of mail.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     HOME      The HOME variable is used by ddeelliivveerrmmaaiill to find the file _m_b_o_x.

     HOSTALIASES
	       Used to find host aliases.
     NAME      DDeelliivveerrmmaaiill extracts the users full name from the NAME vari-
	       able.

     TZ        Used to set the appropriate time zone on the postmark.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     DDeelliivveerrmmaaiill appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix as the program mmaaiill..

BBUUGGSS
     Race conditions sometimes result in a failure to remove a lock file.

     Normally anybody can read your mail, unless it is sent by xsend(1).  An
     installation can overcome this by making mmaaiill a set-user-id command that
     owns the mail directory.
