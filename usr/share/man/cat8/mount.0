     _M_o_u_n_t announces to the system that a removable file system
     is present on the block device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or the remote node
     ``rhost:path''. The file _n_o_d_e must exist already and it must
     be a directory.  It becomes the name of the newly mounted
     root.  The optional arguments -_r and -_w indicate that the
     file system is to be mounted read-only or read-write,
     respectively.  If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _f_i_l_e are not provided,
     the appropriate information is taken from the _f_s_t_a_b file.
     The -_f option causes everything to be done except for the
     actual system call; if it's not obvious, this ``fakes''
     mounting the file system.	This option is useful in conjunc-
     tion with the -_v flag to determine what the _m_o_u_n_t command is
     trying to do.

     The optional argument -_t can be used to indicate the file
     system type.  The type uuffss is the default.  If the type is
     not one of the internally known types, mount will attempt to
     execute a program in //ssbbiinn//mmoouunntt__XXXXXX where XXXXXX is replaced
     by the type name.	The standard mount options (see below)
     are parsed and passed to external program via the -_F option
     as a decimal number.  Any additional options specific to the
     program can be passed as a comma separated list; these
     options are distinguished by starting with a - (dash).
     Those options that take a value are specified using the syn-
     tax -option=value.  For example, the mount command:
	  mount -t mfs -o nosuid,-N,-s=4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp
     causes mount to attempt to execute:
	  /sbin/mount_mfs -F 8 -N -s 4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     Options are specified by a -_o argument followed by a comma
     separated string of options.  The following options apply to
     any file system that is being mounted:

     noexec	 Do not allow execution of any binaries on the
		 mounted file system.  This options is useful for
		 a server that has file systems containing
		 binaries for architectures other than its own.

     nosuid	 Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-

		 identifier bits to take effect.

     nodev	 Do not interpret character or block special dev-
		 ices on the file system.  This options is useful
		 for a server that has file systems containing
		 special devices for architectures other than its
		 own.

     synchronous All I/O to the file system should be done syn-
		 chronously.

     The -_u flag indicates that the status of an already mounted
     file system should be changed.  Any of the options above may
     be changed; also a file system can be changed from read-only
     to read-write.  The set of options is determined by first
     extracting the options for the file system from the _f_s_t_a_b
     table, then applying any options specified by the -_o argu-
     ment, and finally applying the -_r or -_w option.

     The following list can be used to override the defaults for
     an nfs mount:

     hard	 I/O system calls will retry until the server
		 responds (default)

     soft	 I/O system calls will fail and return errno
		 after _r_e_t_r_a_n_s request retransmissions

     spongy	 Soft semantics for the stat, lookup, fsstat,
		 readlink and readdir filesystem operations and
		 hard semantics for the others.  This option is
		 meant to be similar to hard, except that
		 processes will not be hung forever when they
		 trip over mount points to dead servers.

     bg          If the first mount request times out, do retries
		 in background

     intr	 I/O system calls can be interrupted.

     noconn	 Do not connect the socket.  Used for UDP servers
		 that send replies from a socket other than the
		 nfs server socket.

     tcp	 Use TCP transport instead of UDP.

     rsize=#	 Set read size to # bytes.

     wsize=#	 Set write size to # bytes.

     retry=#	 Set mount retry count to #.

     retrans=#	 Set retransmission count for nfs rpc's to #.

     timeo=#	 Set initial nfs timeout to # in 0.1 sec inter-
		 vals.

     _U_m_o_u_n_t announces to the system that the removable file sys-
     tem _n_o_d_e or whatever removable file system was previously
     mounted on device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l should be removed.  If the -_f
     option is specified for _u_m_o_u_n_t, the file system is forcibly
     unmounted.  Active special devices continue to work, but all
     other files return errors if further accesses are attempted.
     The root file system cannot be forcibly unmounted.

     If the -_a option is present for either _m_o_u_n_t or _u_m_o_u_n_t, all
     of the file systems described in _f_s_t_a_b are mounted or
     unmounted.  The optional argument -_t can be used to indicate
     that the actions should only be taken on filesystems of the
     specified type.  More than one type may be specified in a
     comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
     prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types on
     which no action should be taken.  For example, the mount
     command:
	  mount -a -t nonfs,mfs
     mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and MFS.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file sys-
     tems.  If invoked without an argument, _m_o_u_n_t prints the
     list.  The optional argument -_t can be used to indicate that
     only filesystems of the specified type should be listed.
     More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
     list.  The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
     ``no'' to indicate the types of filesystems to be excluded
     from the listing.

     Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file systems
     must be mounted read-only or errors will occur when access
     times are updated, whether or not any explicit write is
     attempted.

     Mounting garbaged file systems will crash the system.

     Mounting a root directory on a non-directory makes some
     apparently good path names invalid.
