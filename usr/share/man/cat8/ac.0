     _A_c produces a printout giving connect time for each user who
     has logged in during the life of the current _w_t_m_p file.  A
     total is also produced.  --ww is used to specify an alternate
     _w_t_m_p file.  --pp prints individual totals; without this
     option, only totals are printed.  --dd causes a printout for
     each midnight to midnight period.	Any _p_e_o_p_l_e will limit the
     printout to only the specified login names.  If no _w_t_m_p file
     is given, /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p is used.

     The accounting file /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_w_t_m_p is maintained by _i_n_i_t and
     _l_o_g_i_n. Neither of these programs creates the file, so if it
     does not exist no connect-time accounting is done.  To start
     accounting, it should be created with length 0.  On the
     other hand if the file is left undisturbed it will grow
     without bound, so periodically any information desired
     should be collected and the file truncated.
