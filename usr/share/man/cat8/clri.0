       NN..BB..:: _C_l_r_i is obsoleted for normal file system repair work
       by _f_s_c_k(8).

       _C_l_r_i writes zeros on  the  i-nodes  with  the  decimal  _i_-
       _n_u_m_b_e_r_s  on the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_.  After _c_l_r_i_, any blocks in the
       affected file will show up as `missing' in an _i_c_h_e_c_k(8) of
       the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_.

       Read  and  write  permission  is required on the specified
       file system device.  The i-node becomes allocatable.

       The primary purpose of this routine is to  remove  a  file
       which  for  some reason appears in no directory.  If it is
       used to zap an i-node which does appear  in  a  directory,
       care  should  be  taken to track down the entry and remove
       it.  Otherwise, when the i-node is reallocated to some new
       file,  the  old  entry  will still point to that file.  At
       that point removing the old entry  will  destroy  the  new
       file.  The new entry will again point to an unallocated i-
       node, so the whole cycle is likely to  be  repeated  again
       and again.

       If the file is open, _c_l_r_i is likely to be ineffective.
