     UNIX is started by placing it in memory at location zero and
     transferring to the entry point.  Since the system is not
     reenterable, it is necessary to read it in from disk or tape
     each time it is to be bootstrapped.

     reboot is desired, _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(8) is normally used.  If there
     are no users then rreebboooott can be used.  Reboot causes the
     disks to be synced and allows the system to perform other
     shutdown activities such as resynchronizing hardware time-
     of-day clocks.  A multi-user reboot (as described below) is
     then initiated.  This causes a system to be booted and an
     automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
     without incident, the system is then brought up for many
     users.

     Options to reboot are:

     --nn   option avoids the sync.  It can be used if a disk or
	  the processor is on fire.

     --qq   reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down
	  running processes first.

     _R_e_b_o_o_t normally logs the reboot using _s_y_s_l_o_g(8) and places a
     shutdown record in the login accounting file /var/log/wtmp.
     These actions are inhibited if the --nn or --qq options are
     present.

     reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.  An automatic
     consistency check of the file systems will be performed as
     described in _f_s_c_k(8).  and unless this fails, the system
     will resume multi-user operations.

     Power 6/32 and related processors, the system will do a
     standard autoboot from drive 0 upon power-up or reset.  This
     automatic boot may be cancelled by typing a "#" in the first
     few seconds after reset.  This enters console mode; the con-
     sole prompt is ">" or "#>".  The boot flags can be set to
     any hexadecimal value _n with the command

	  #> p23 _n.

     The default device may be examined or set; see the Diagnos-
     tics and Debugging manual for the processor for details on
     device naming and syntax.	After setting the boot flags
     and/or device, a bootstrap sequence can be initiated with

	  #> fb

     A specific device or bootstrap file may be used; for exam-
     ple,

	  #> fb xfd(1,0)

     would boot from the `a' partition on XFD drive 1.

     The file specifications used for the boostrap when loaded
     with the "askme" flag (register 23 set to 1 or 3) are of the
     form:

	  device(adaptor,controller,unit,minor)

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is the type of the device to be searched, _a_d_a_p_-
     _t_o_r is number of the VERSAbus (or VMEbus) to which the dev-
     ice is attached, _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r is the unit number of the con-
     troller on that buss, _u_n_i_t is the unit number of the disk or
     tape, and _m_i_n_o_r is the disk partition or tape file number.
     Leading adaptor or controller numbers default to 0.  Normal
     line editing characters can be used when typing the file
     specification.  The following list of supported devices may
     vary from installation to installation:

	  dk   SMD or ESDI disks on VDDC or SMD-E
	  cy   tape on Ciprico Tapemaster controller

     For example, to boot from a file system which starts at
     cylinder 0 of unit 0 of an SMD-E disk, type "dk(0,0)vmunix"
     to the boot prompt; "dk(2,1,0)vmunix" would specify drive 1
     on SMD-E controller 2.

     In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the
     paper ``Installing and Operating 4.3BSD-tahoe UNIX on the
     Tahoe'' can be used to boot from a distribution tape.
