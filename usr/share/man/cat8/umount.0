     The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree
     at the point _n_o_d_e_. If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appro-
     priate information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no ar-
     guments are given to mmoouunntt,, this list is printed.

     Options available for the mmoouunntt command:

     --FF      The standard mount options are parsed and passed to external pro-
             gram via the --FF option as a decimal number.  (See example below.)

     --dd      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
             This option is useful in conjunction with the --vv flag to deter-
             mine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

     --ff      Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
             filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  The following options apply to any file
             system that is being mounted:

             noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
                     file system.  This options is useful for a server that
                     has file systems containing binaries for architectures
                     other than its own.

             nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
                     bits to take effect.

             nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
                     the file system.  This options is useful for a server
                     that has file systems containing special devices for ar-
                     chitectures other than its own.

             synchronous
                     All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

             union   Causes the namespace at the mount point to appear as the
                     union of the mounted filesystem root and the existing di-
                     rectory.  Lookups will be done in the mounted filesystem
                     first.  If those operations fail due to a non-existent
                     file the underlying directory is then accessed.  All cre-
                     ates are done in the mounted filesystem.

     --rr      The file system object is to be mounted read-only.

     --tt _u_f_s | _l_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
             The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the file system
             type.  The type _u_f_s is the default.  The _-_t option can be used to
             indicate that the actions should only be taken on filesystems of
             the specified type.  More than one type may be specified in a
             comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be pre-
             fixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types on which no ac-
             tion should be taken.  For example, the mmoouunntt command:

                   mount -a -t nonfs,mfs

             mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and MFS.

             If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
             attempt to execute a program in _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___X_X_X where _X_X_X is re-
             placed by the type name.  For example, nfs filesystems are mount-
             ed by the program _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___n_f_s.

     --uu      The --uu flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the --oo option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
             from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
             filesystem are currently open for writing unless the --ff flag is
             also specified.  The set of options is determined by first ex-
             tracting the options for the file system from the fstab table,
             then applying any options specified by the --oo argument, and fi-
             nally applying the --rr or --ww option.

     --vv      Verbose mode.

     --ww      The file system object is to be read and write.

     --       Any additional options specific to the program can be passed as a
             comma separated list; these options are distinguished by starting
             with a -- (dash).

     Those options that take a value are specified using the syntax -op-
     tion=value.  For example, the mount command:

           mount -t mfs -o nosuid,-N,-s=4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     causes mount to attempt to execute:

           /sbin/mount_mfs -F 8 -N -s 4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the mount_nfs(8)
     manual page.

     UUmmoouunntt removes the _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device grafted at point _n_o_d_e from file system
     tree.

     Options for the uummoouunntt command:

     --ff      The file system is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
             continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
             accesses are attempted.  The root file system cannot be forcibly
             unmounted.

     --aa      All of the file systems described in fstab(5) are unmounted.

     --tt      Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-
             tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified
             in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
             prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types on which no
             action should be taken.  (See example above for the mmoouunntt com-
             mand.)
