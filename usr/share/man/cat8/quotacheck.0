     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k examines each filesystem, builds a table of
     current disk usage, and compares this table against that
     recorded in the disk quota file for the filesystem.  If any
     inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file and the
     current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the
     latter only occurs if an active filesystem is checked).  By
     default both user and group quotas are checked.  The
     optional -_g flag specifies that only group quotas should be
     checked.  The optional -_u flag specifies that only user quo-
     tas should be checked.  Specifying both -_g and -_u is
     equivalent to the default.

     If the --aa flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
     _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will check all the filesystems indicated in
     /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b to be read-write with disk quotas.  By default
     only the types of quotas listed in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b are checked.
     The optional -_g flag specifies that only group quotas listed
     in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b should be checked.  The optional -_u flag
     specifies that only user quotas listed in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b should
     be checked.  Specifying both -_g and -_u is equivalent to the
     default.  Parallel passes are run on the filesystems
     required, using the pass numbers in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b in an identi-
     cal fashion to _f_s_c_k(8).

     Normally _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k operates silently.  If the --vv option is
     supplied, _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will report discrepancies between the
     calculated and recorded disk quotas.

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
     quota files named _q_u_o_t_a._u_s_e_r and _q_u_o_t_a._g_r_o_u_p which are
     located at the root of the associated file system.  These
     defaults may be overridden in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b . If a file is not
     present, _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k will create it.

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k is normally run at boot time from the
     /_e_t_c/_r_c._l_o_c_a_l file, see _r_c(8), before enabling disk quotas
     with _q_u_o_t_a_o_n(8).

     _Q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
     disk usage for each user.	Thus, the filesystems checked
     should be quiescent while _q_u_o_t_a_c_h_e_c_k is running.
