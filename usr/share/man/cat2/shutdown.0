DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n call causes all or part of a full-duplex con-
     nection on the socket associated with _s to be shut down.  If
     _h_o_w is 0, then further receives will be disallowed.  If _h_o_w
     is 1, then further sends will be disallowed.  If _h_o_w is 2,
     then further sends and receives will be disallowed.

     A 0 is returned if the call succeeds, -1 if it fails.

EERRRROORRSS
     The call succeeds unless:

     [EBADF]	    _S is not a valid descriptor.

     [ENOTSOCK]     _S is a file, not a socket.

     [ENOTCONN]     The specified socket is not connected.
