     _U_n_l_i_n_k removes the entry for the file _p_a_t_h from its direc-
     tory.  If this entry was the last link to the file, and no
     process has the file open, then all resources associated
     with the file are reclaimed.  If, however, the file was open
     in any process, the actual resource reclamation is delayed
     until it is closed, even though the directory entry has
     disappeared.

     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.
