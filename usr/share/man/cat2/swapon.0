     _S_w_a_p_o_n makes the block device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l available to the sys-
     tem for allocation for paging and swapping.  The names of
     potentially available devices are known to the system and
     defined at system configuration time.  The size of the swap
     area on _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is calculated at the time the device is
     first made available for swapping.

     If an error has occurred, a value of -1 is returned and

     _S_w_a_p_o_n succeeds unless:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named device does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

     [ENOTBLK]	    _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is not a block device.

     [EBUSY]	    The device specified by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l has already
		    been made available for swapping

     [EINVAL]	    The device configured by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l was not con-
		    figured into the system as a swap device.

     [ENXIO]	    The major device number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is out of
		    range (this indicates no device driver exists

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while opening the swap
		    device.

     [EFAULT]	    _S_p_e_c_i_a_l points outside the process's allo-
		    cated address space.

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack
     may be dismounted.

     This call will be upgraded in future versions of the system.
