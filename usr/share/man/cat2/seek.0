     The descriptor _d refers to a file or device open for reading
     and/or writing.  _L_s_e_e_k sets the file pointer of _d as fol-
     lows:

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_SET, the pointer is set to _o_f_f_s_e_t
	  bytes.

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_CUR, the pointer is set to its
	  current location plus _o_f_f_s_e_t.

	  If _w_h_e_n_c_e is SEEK_END, the pointer is set to the size
	  of the file plus _o_f_f_s_e_t.

     Upon successful completion, the resulting pointer location
     as measured in bytes from beginning of the file is returned.
     Some devices are incapable of seeking.  The value of the
     pointer associated with such a device is undefined.

NNOOTTEESS
     Seeking far beyond the end of a file, then writing, creates
     a gap or "hole", which occupies no physical space and reads
     as zeros.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     Upon successful completion, the current file pointer value
     is returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o
     is set to indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     _L_s_e_e_k will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged
     if:

     [EBADF]	    _F_i_l_d_e_s is not an open file descriptor.

     [ESPIPE]	    _F_i_l_d_e_s is associated with a pipe or a socket.

     [EINVAL]	    _W_h_e_n_c_e is not a proper value.
