     This section describes both a particular special file
     //ddeevv//ttttyy and the terminal drivers used for conversational
     computing.

     LLiinnee ddiisscciipplliinneess..

     The system provides different _l_i_n_e _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e_s for control-
     ling communications lines.  In this version of the system
     there are two disciplines available for use with terminals:

     old     The old (Version 7) terminal driver.  This is some-
	     times used when using the standard shell _s_h(1).

     new     The standard Berkeley terminal driver, with features
	     for job control; this must be used when using
	     _c_s_h(1).

     Line discipline switching is accomplished with the TIOCSETD
     _i_o_c_t_l:

	  iinntt llddiisscc == LLDDIISSCC;;
	  iiooccttll((ff,, TTIIOOCCSSEETTDD,, &&llddiisscc));;

     where LDISC is OTTYDISC for the standard tty driver and
     NTTYDISC for the ``new'' driver.  The standard (currently
     old) tty driver is discipline 0 by convention.  Other dis-
     ciplines may exist for special purposes, such as use of com-
     munications lines for network connections.  The current line
     discipline can be obtained with the TIOCGETD _i_o_c_t_l.  Pending
     input is discarded when the line discipline is changed.

     All of the low-speed asynchronous communications ports can
     use any of the available line disciplines, no matter what
     hardware is involved.  The remainder of this section
     discusses the "old" and "new" disciplines.

     When a terminal file is opened, it causes the process to
     wait until a connection is established.  In practice, user
     programs seldom open these files; they are opened by
     _g_e_t_t_y(8) or _r_l_o_g_i_n_d(8C) and become a user's standard input
     and output file.

     If a process which has no control terminal opens a terminal
     file, then that terminal file becomes the control terminal
     for that process.	The control terminal is thereafter inher-
     ited by a child process during a _f_o_r_k(2), even if the con-
     trol terminal is closed.

     The file //ddeevv//ttttyy is, in each process, a synonym for a _c_o_n_-
     _t_r_o_l _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l associated with that process.  It is useful
     for programs that wish to be sure of writing messages on the
     terminal no matter how output has been redirected.  It can
     also be used for programs that demand a file name for out-
     put, when typed output is desired and it is tiresome to find
     out which terminal is currently in use.

     A process can remove the association it has with its con-
     trolling terminal by opening the file //ddeevv//ttttyy and issuing
     an

	  iiooccttll((ff,, TTIIOOCCNNOOTTTTYY,, 00));;

     This is often desirable in server processes.

     PPrroocceessss ggrroouuppss..

     Command processors such as _c_s_h(1) can arbitrate the terminal
     between different _j_o_b_s by placing related jobs in a single
     process group and associating this process group with the
     terminal.	A terminal's associated process group may be set
     using the TIOCSPGRP _i_o_c_t_l(2):

	  iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, TTIIOOCCSSPPGGRRPP,, &&ppggrrpp));;

     or examined using TIOCGPGRP, which returns the current pro-
     cess group in _p_g_r_p.  The new terminal driver aids in this
     arbitration by restricting access to the terminal by
     processes which are not in the current process group; see
     JJoobb aacccceessss ccoonnttrrooll below.

     MMooddeess..

     The terminal drivers have three major modes, characterized
     by the amount of processing on the input and output charac-
     ters:

     cooked    The normal mode.  In this mode lines of input are
	       collected and input editing is done.  The edited
	       line is made available when it is completed by a
	       newline, or when the _t__b_r_k_c character (normally
	       undefined) or _t__e_o_f_c character (normally an EOT,
	       control-D, hereafter ^D) is entered.  A carriage
	       return is usually made synonymous with newline in
	       this mode, and replaced with a newline whenever it

	       is typed.  All driver functions (input editing,
	       interrupt generation, output processing such as
	       delay generation and tab expansion, etc.) are
	       available in this mode.

     CBREAK    This mode eliminates the character, word, and line
	       editing input facilities, making the input charac-
	       ter available to the user program as it is typed.
	       Flow control, literal-next and interrupt process-
	       ing are still done in this mode.  Output process-
	       ing is done.

     RAW       This mode eliminates all input processing and
	       makes all input characters available as they are
	       typed; no output processing is done either.

     The style of input processing can also be very different
     when the terminal is put in non-blocking I/O mode; see the
     FNDELAY flag described in _f_c_n_t_l(2).  In this case a _r_e_a_d(2)
     from the control terminal will never block, but rather
     return an error indication (EWOULDBLOCK) if there is no
     input available.

     A process may also request that a SIGIO signal be sent it
     whenever input is present and also whenever output queues
     fall below the low-water mark.  To enable this mode the
     FASYNC flag should be set using _f_c_n_t_l(2).

     IInnppuutt eeddiittiinngg..

     A UNIX terminal ordinarily operates in full-duplex mode.
     Characters may be typed at any time, even while output is
     occurring, and are only lost when the system's character
     input buffers become completely choked, which is rare, or
     when the user has accumulated the maximum allowed number of
     input characters that have not yet been read by some pro-
     gram.  Currently this limit is 256 characters.  In RAW mode,
     the terminal driver throws away all input and output without
     notice when the limit is reached.	In CBREAK or cooked mode
     it refuses to accept any further input and, if in the new
     line discipline, rings the terminal bell.

     Input characters are normally accepted in either even or odd
     parity with the parity bit being stripped off before the
     character is given to the program.  By clearing either the
     EVEN or ODD bit in the flags word it is possible to have
     input characters with that parity discarded (see the SSuummmmaarryy
     below.)

     In all of the line disciplines, it is possible to simulate
     terminal input using the TIOCSTI _i_o_c_t_l, which takes, as its
     third argument, the address of a character.  The system



Printed 7/27/90             February				3






TTY(4)			      1989			   TTY(4)



     pretends that this character was typed on the argument ter-
     minal, which must be the control terminal except for the
     super-user (this call is not in standard version 7 UNIX).

     Input characters are normally echoed by putting them in an
     output queue as they arrive.  This may be disabled by clear-
     ing the ECHO bit in the flags word using the _s_t_t_y(3C) call
     or the TIOCSETN or TIOCSETP _i_o_c_t_ls (see the SSuummmmaarryy below).

     In cooked mode, terminal input is processed in units of
     lines.  A program attempting to read will normally be
     suspended until an entire line has been received (but see
     the description of SIGTTIN in JJoobb aacccceessss ccoonnttrrooll and of
     FIONREAD in SSuummmmaarryy, both below.) No matter how many charac-
     ters are requested in the read call, at most one line will
     be returned.  It is not, however, necessary to read a whole
     line at once; any number of characters may be requested in a
     read, even one, without losing information.

     During input, line editing is normally done, with the erase
     character _s_g__e_r_a_s_e (by default, DELETE) logically erasing
     the last character typed and the _s_g__k_i_l_l character (default,
     ^U: control-U) logically erasing the entire current input
     line.  These characters never erase beyond the beginning of
     the current input line or an eof.	These characters may be
     entered literally by preceding them with `\'; the `\' will
     normally be erased when the character is typed.

     The drivers normally treat either a carriage return or a
     newline character as terminating an input line, replacing
     the return with a newline and echoing a return and a line
     feed.  If the CRMOD bit is cleared in the local mode word
     then the processing for carriage return is disabled, and it
     is simply echoed as a return, and does not terminate cooked
     mode input.

     In the new driver there is a literal-next character (nor-
     mally ^V) which can be typed in both cooked and CBREAK mode
     preceding _a_n_y character to prevent its special meaning to
     the terminal handler.  This is to be preferred to the use of
     `\' escaping erase and kill characters, but `\' is retained
     with its old function in the new line discipline.

     The new terminal driver also provides two other editing
     characters in normal mode.  The word-erase character, nor-
     mally ^W, erases the preceding word, but not any spaces
     before it.  For the purposes of ^W, a word is defined as a
     sequence of non-blank characters, with tabs counted as
     blanks.  Finally, the reprint character, normally ^R,
     retypes the pending input beginning on a new line.  Retyping
     occurs automatically in cooked mode if characters which
     would normally be erased from the screen are fouled by

     The terminal driver has several modes (not present in stan-
     dard UNIX Version 7 systems) for handling the echoing of
     terminal input, controlled by bits in a local mode word.

     _H_a_r_d_c_o_p_y _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s. When a hardcopy terminal is in use, the
     LPRTERA bit is normally set in the local mode word.  Charac-
     ters which are logically erased are then printed out back-
     wards preceded by `\' and followed by `/' in this mode.

     _C_R_T _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s. When a CRT terminal is in use, the LCRTBS bit
     is normally set in the local mode word.  The terminal driver
     then echoes the proper number of erase characters when input
     is erased; in the normal case where the erase character is a
     ^H this causes the cursor of the terminal to back up to
     where it was before the logically erased character was
     typed.  If the input has become fouled due to interspersed
     asynchronous output, the input is automatically retyped.

     _E_r_a_s_i_n_g _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _f_r_o_m _a _C_R_T. When a CRT terminal is in
     use, the LCRTERA bit may be set to cause input to be erased
     from the screen with a "backspace-space-backspace" sequence
     when character or word deleting sequences are used.  A
     LCRTKIL bit may be set as well, causing the input to be
     erased in this manner on line kill sequences as well.

     _E_c_h_o_i_n_g _o_f _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s. If the LCTLECH bit is set in
     the local state word, then non-printing (control) characters
     are normally echoed as ^X (for some X) rather than being
     echoed unmodified; delete is echoed as ^?.

     The normal modes for use on CRT terminals are speed depen-
     dent.  At speeds less than 1200 baud, the LCRTERA and
     LCRTKILL processing is painfully slow, and _s_t_t_y(1) normally
     just sets LCRTBS and LCTLECH; at speeds of 1200 baud or
     greater all of these bits are normally set.  _S_t_t_y(1) summar-
     izes these option settings and the use of the new terminal
     driver as "newcrt."

     OOuuttppuutt pprroocceessssiinngg..

     When one or more characters are written, they are actually
     transmitted to the terminal as soon as previously-written
     characters have finished typing.  (As noted above, input
     characters are normally echoed by putting them in the output
     queue as they arrive.) When a process produces characters
     more rapidly than they can be typed, it will be suspended
     when its output queue exceeds some limit.	When the queue
     has drained down to some threshold the program is resumed.



Printed 7/27/90             February				5






TTY(4)			      1989			   TTY(4)



     Even parity is normally generated on output.  The EOT char-
     acter is not transmitted in cooked mode to prevent terminals
     that respond to it from hanging up; programs using RAW or
     CBREAK mode should be careful.

     The terminal drivers provide necessary processing for cooked
     and CBREAK mode output including delay generation for cer-
     tain special characters and parity generation.   Delays are
     available after backspaces ^H, form feeds ^L, carriage
     returns ^M, tabs ^I and newlines ^J.  The driver will also
     optionally expand tabs into spaces, where the tab stops are
     assumed to be set every eight columns, and optionally con-
     vert newlines to carriage returns followed by newline.
     These functions are controlled by bits in the tty flags
     word; see SSuummmmaarryy below.

     The terminal drivers provide for mapping between upper and
     lower case on terminals lacking lower case, and for other
     special processing on deficient terminals.

     Finally, in the new terminal driver, there is a output flush
     character, normally ^O, which sets the LFLUSHO bit in the
     local mode word, causing subsequent output to be flushed
     until it is cleared by a program or more input is typed.
     This character has effect in both cooked and CBREAK modes
     and causes pending input to be retyped if there is any pend-
     ing input.  An _i_o_c_t_l to flush the characters in the input or
     output queues, TIOCFLUSH, is also available.

     If the LCASE bit is set in the tty flags, then all upper-
     case letters are mapped into the corresponding lower-case
     letter.  The upper-case letter may be generated by preceding
     it by `\'.  Upper case letters are preceded by a `\' when
     output.  In addition, the following escape sequences can be
     generated on output and accepted on input:

     for  `    |    ~	 {    }
     use  \'   \!   \^	 \(   \)

     To deal with Hazeltine terminals, which do not understand
     that ~ has been made into an ASCII character, the LTILDE bit
     may be set in the local mode word; in this case the charac-
     ter ~ will be replaced with the character ` on output.

     FFllooww ccoonnttrrooll..

     There are two characters (the stop character, normally ^S,
     and the start character, normally ^Q) which cause output to
     be suspended and resumed respectively.  Extra stop charac-
     ters typed when output is already stopped have no effect,



Printed 7/27/90             February				6






TTY(4)			      1989			   TTY(4)



     unless the start and stop characters are made the same, in
     which case output resumes.

     A bit in the flags word may be set to put the terminal into
     TANDEM mode.  In this mode the system produces a stop char-
     acter (default ^S) when the input queue is in danger of
     overflowing, and a start character (default ^Q) when the
     input has drained sufficiently.  This mode is useful when
     the terminal is actually another machine that obeys those
     conventions.

     LLiinnee ccoonnttrrooll aanndd bbrreeaakkss..

     There are several _i_o_c_t_l calls available to control the state
     of the terminal line.  The TIOCSBRK _i_o_c_t_l will set the break
     bit in the hardware interface causing a break condition to
     exist; this can be cleared (usually after a delay with
     _s_l_e_e_p(3)) by TIOCCBRK.  Break conditions in the input are
     reflected as a null character in RAW mode or as the inter-
     rupt character in cooked or CBREAK mode.  The TIOCCDTR _i_o_c_t_l
     will clear the data terminal ready condition; it can be set
     again by TIOCSDTR.

     When the carrier signal from the dataset drops (usually
     because the user has hung up his terminal) a SIGHUP hangup
     signal is sent to the processes in the distinguished process
     group of the terminal; this usually causes them to ter-
     minate.  The SIGHUP can be suppressed by setting the LNOHANG
     bit in the local state word of the driver.  Access to the
     terminal by other processes is then normally revoked, so any
     further reads will fail, and programs that read a terminal
     and test for end-of-file on their input will terminate
     appropriately.

     It is possible to ask that the phone line be hung up on the
     last close with the TIOCHPCL _i_o_c_t_l; this is normally done on
     the outgoing lines and dialups.

     There are several characters that generate interrupts in
     cooked and CBREAK mode; all are sent to the processes in the
     control group of the terminal, as if a TIOCGPGRP _i_o_c_t_l were
     done to get the process group and then a _k_i_l_l_p_g(2) system
     call were done, except that these characters also flush
     pending input and output when typed at a terminal ('_a`'_l_a
     TIOCFLUSH).  The characters shown here are the defaults; the
     field names in the structures (given below) are also shown.
     The characters may be changed.

     ^C   tt__iinnttrrcc (ETX) generates a SIGINT signal.  This is the
	  normal way to stop a process which is no longer

	  interesting, or to regain control in an interactive
	  program.

     ^\   tt__qquuiittcc (FS) generates a SIGQUIT signal.  This is used
	  to cause a program to terminate and produce a core
	  image, if possible, in the file ccoorree in the current
	  directory.

     ^Z   tt__ssuussppcc (EM) generates a SIGTSTP signal, which is used
	  to suspend the current process group.

     ^Y   tt__ddssuussppcc (SUB) generates a SIGTSTP signal as ^Z does,
	  but the signal is sent when a program attempts to read
	  the ^Y, rather than when it is typed.

     When using the new terminal driver, if a process which is
     not in the distinguished process group of its control termi-
     nal attempts to read from that terminal its process group is
     sent a SIGTTIN signal.  This signal normally causes the
     members of that process group to stop. If, however, the pro-
     cess is ignoring SIGTTIN, has SIGTTIN blocked, or is in the
     middle of process creation using _v_f_o_r_k(2)), the read will
     return -1 and set _e_r_r_n_o to EIO.

     When using the new terminal driver with the LTOSTOP bit set
     in the local modes, a process is prohibited from writing on
     its control terminal if it is not in the distinguished pro-
     cess group for that terminal.  Processes which are holding
     or ignoring SIGTTOU signals or which are in the middle of a
     _v_f_o_r_k(2) are excepted and allowed to produce output.

     In order to accommodate terminals and workstations with
     variable-sized windows, the terminal driver provides a
     mechanism for obtaining and setting the current terminal
     size.  The driver does not use this information internally,
     but only stores it and provides a uniform access mechanism.
     When the size is changed, a SIGWINCH signal is sent to the
     terminal's process group so that knowledgeable programs may
     detect size changes.  This facility was added in 4.3BSD and
     is not available in earlier versions of the system.

     additional control characters added in version 7.	The third
     is a word of local state added in 4BSD, and the fourth is
     another structure of special characters added for the new
     driver.  In the future a single structure may be made avail-
     able to programs which need to access all this information;
     most programs need not concern themselves with all this
     state.

     _B_a_s_i_c _m_o_d_e_s: _s_g_t_t_y.

     The basic _i_o_c_t_ls use the structure defined in <_s_g_t_t_y._h>:

     ssttrruucctt ssggttttyybb {{
	  cchhaarr ssgg__iissppeeeedd;;

     The _s_g__i_s_p_e_e_d and _s_g__o_s_p_e_e_d fields describe the input and
     output speeds of the device according to the following
     table, which corresponds to the DEC DH-11 interface.  If
     other hardware is used, impossible speed changes are
     ignored.  Symbolic values in the table are as defined in
     <_s_g_t_t_y._h>.

     Code conversion and line control required for IBM 2741's

     half-duplex line discipline required for the 202 dataset
     (1200 baud) is not supplied; full-duplex 212 datasets work
     fine.

     The _s_g__e_r_a_s_e and _s_g__k_i_l_l fields of the argument structure
     specify the erase and kill characters respectively.

     (Defaults are DELETE and ^U.)

     The _s_g__f_l_a_g_s field of the argument structure contains
     several bits that determine the system's treatment of the
     terminal:

     NL3      0001400
     EVENP    0000200 Even parity allowed on input
     ODDP     0000100 Odd parity allowed on input
     RAW      0000040 Raw mode: wake up on all characters, 8-bit interface
     CRMOD    0000020 Map CR into LF; output LF as CR-LF
     ECHO     0000010 Echo (full duplex)
     LCASE    0000004 Map upper case to lower on input and lower to upper on output
     CBREAK   0000002 Return each character as soon as typed
     TANDEM   0000001 Automatic flow control

     The delay bits specify how long transmission stops to allow
     for mechanical or other movement when certain characters are
     sent to the terminal.  In all cases a value of 0 indicates
     no delay.

     Backspace delays are currently ignored but might be used for
     Terminet 300's.

     If a form-feed/vertical tab delay is specified, it lasts for
     about 2 seconds.

     Carriage-return delay type 1 lasts about .08 seconds and is
     suitable for the Terminet 300.  Delay type 2 lasts about .16
     seconds and is suitable for the VT05 and the TI 700.  Delay
     type 3 is suitable for the concept-100 and pads lines to be

     at least 9 characters at 9600 baud.

     New-line delay type 1 is dependent on the current column and
     is tuned for Teletype model 37's.	Type 2 is useful for the
     VT05 and is about .10 seconds.  Type 3 is unimplemented and
     is 0.

     Tab delay type 1 is dependent on the amount of movement and
     is tuned to the Teletype model 37.  Type 3, called XTABS, is
     not a delay at all but causes tabs to be replaced by the
     appropriate number of spaces on output.

     The flags for even and odd parity control parity checking on
     input and generation on output in cooked and CBREAK mode
     (unless LPASS8 is enabled, see below).  Even parity is gen-
     erated on output unless ODDP is set and EVENP is clear, in
     which case odd parity is generated.  Input characters with
     the wrong parity, as determined by EVENP and ODDP, are
     ignored in cooked and CBREAK mode.

     RAW disables all processing save output flushing with
     LFLUSHO; full 8 bits of input are given as soon as it is
     available; all 8 bits are passed on output.  A break condi-
     tion in the input is reported as a null character.  If the
     input queue overflows in raw mode all data in the input and
     output queues are discarded; this applies to both new and
     old drivers.

     CRMOD causes input carriage returns to be turned into new-
     lines, and output and echoed new-lines to be output as a
     carriage return followed by a line feed.

     CBREAK is a sort of half-cooked (rare?) mode.  Programs can
     read each character as soon as typed, instead of waiting for
     a full line; all processing is done except the input edit-
     ing: character and word erase and line kill, input reprint,
     and the special treatment of \ and EOT are disabled.

     TANDEM mode causes the system to produce a stop character
     (default ^S) whenever the input queue is in danger of over-
     flowing, and a start character (default ^Q) when the input
     queue has drained sufficiently.  It is useful for flow con-
     trol when the `terminal' is really another computer which
     understands the conventions.

     NNoottee:: The same ``stop'' and ``start'' characters are used
     for both directions of flow control; the _t__s_t_o_p_c character
     is accepted on input as the character that stops output and
     is produced on output as the character to stop input, and
     the _t__s_t_a_r_t_c character is accepted on input as the character
     that restarts output and is produced on output as the char-
     acter to restart input.

     _B_a_s_i_c _i_o_c_t_l_s

     A large number of _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls apply to terminals.  Some
     have the general form:

     ##iinncclluuddee <<ssggttttyy..hh>>

     iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, ccooddee,, aarrgg))
     ssttrruucctt ssggttttyybb **aarrgg;;

     The applicable codes are:

     TIOCGETP	    Fetch the basic parameters associated with
		    the terminal, and store in the pointed-to
		    _s_g_t_t_y_b structure.

     TIOCSETP	    Set the parameters according to the pointed-
		    to _s_g_t_t_y_b structure.  The interface delays
		    until output is quiescent, then throws away
		    any unread characters, before changing the
		    modes.

     TIOCSETN	    Set the parameters like TIOCSETP but do not
		    delay or flush input.  Input is not
		    preserved, however, when changing to or from
		    RAW.

     With the following codes _a_r_g is ignored.

     TIOCEXCL	    Set "exclusive-use" mode: no further opens
		    are permitted until the file has been closed.

     TIOCNXCL	    Turn off "exclusive-use" mode.

     TIOCHPCL	    When the file is closed for the last time,
		    hang up the terminal.  This is useful when
		    the line is associated with an ACU used to
		    place outgoing calls.

     With the following codes _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt.

     TIOCGETD	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt into which is
		    placed the current line discipline number.

     TIOCSETD	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt whose value
		    becomes the current line discipline number.

     TIOCFLUSH	    If the iinntt pointed to by _a_r_g has a zero
		    value, all characters waiting in input or
		    output queues are flushed.	Otherwise, the
		    value of the iinntt is for the FREAD and FWRITE
		    bits defined in <<ssyyss//ffiillee..hh>>; if the FREAD

		    bit is set, all characters waiting in input
		    queues are flushed, and if the FWRITE bit is
		    set, all characters waiting in output queues
		    are flushed.

     The remaining calls are not available in vanilla version 7
     UNIX.  In cases where arguments are required, they are
     described; _a_r_g should otherwise be given as 0.

     TIOCSTI	    the argument points to a character which the
		    system pretends had been typed on the termi-
		    nal.

     TIOCSBRK	    the break bit is set in the terminal.

     TIOCCBRK	    the break bit is cleared.

     TIOCSDTR	    data terminal ready is set.

     TIOCCDTR	    data terminal ready is cleared.

     TIOCSTOP	    output is stopped as if the ``stop'' charac-
		    ter had been typed.

     TIOCSTART	    output is restarted as if the ``start'' char-
		    acter had been typed.

     TIOCGPGRP	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt into which is
		    placed the process group ID of the process
		    group for which this terminal is the control
		    terminal.

     TIOCSPGRP	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt which is the value
		    to which the process group ID for this termi-
		    nal will be set.

     TIOCOUTQ	    returns in the iinntt pointed to by _a_r_g the
		    number of characters queued for output to the
		    terminal.

     FIONREAD	    returns in the iinntt pointed to by _a_r_g the
		    number of characters immediately readable
		    from the argument descriptor.  This works for
		    files, pipes, and terminals.

     _T_c_h_a_r_s

     The second structure associated with each terminal specifies
     characters that are special in both the old and new terminal
     interfaces: The following structure is defined in
     <_s_y_s/_i_o_c_t_l._h>, which is automatically included in <_s_g_t_t_y._h>:

     The default values for these characters are ^C, ^\, ^Q, ^S,
     ^D, and -1.  A character value of -1 eliminates the effect
     of that character.  The _t__b_r_k_c character, by default -1,
     acts like a new-line in that it terminates a `line,' is
     echoed, and is passed to the program.  The `stop' and
     `start' characters may be the same, to produce a toggle
     effect.  It is probably counterproductive to make other spe-
     cial characters (including erase and kill) identical.  The
     applicable _i_o_c_t_l calls are:

     TIOCGETC	 Get the special characters and put them in the
		 specified structure.

     TIOCSETC	 Set the special characters to those given in the
		 structure.

     _L_o_c_a_l _m_o_d_e

     The third structure associated with each terminal is a local
     mode word.  The bits of the local mode word are:

     LCRTBS    000001	 Backspace on erase rather than echoing erase
     LPRTERA   000002	 Printing terminal erase mode
     LCRTERA   000004	 Erase character echoes as backspace-space-backspace
     LTILDE    000010	 Convert ~ to ` on output (for Hazeltine terminals)
     LMDMBUF   000020	 Stop/start output when carrier drops
     LLITOUT   000040	 Suppress output translations
     LTOSTOP   000100	 Send SIGTTOU for background output
     LFLUSHO   000200	 Output is being flushed
     LNOHANG   000400	 Don't send hangup when carrier drops
     LETXACK   001000	 Diablo style buffer hacking (unimplemented)
     LCRTKIL   002000	 BS-space-BS erase entire line on line kill
     LPASS8    004000	 Pass all 8 bits through on input, in any mode
     LCTLECH   010000	 Echo input control chars as ^X, delete as ^?
     LPENDIN   020000	 Retype pending input at next read or input character
     LDECCTQ   040000	 Only ^Q restarts output after ^S, like DEC systems
     LNOFLSH   100000	 Inhibit flushing of pending I/O when an interrupt character is typed.

     The applicable _i_o_c_t_l functions are:

     TIOCLBIS	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt whose value is a

     TIOCLSET	    _a_r_g is a pointer to an iinntt whose value is

     _L_o_c_a_l _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _c_h_a_r_s

     The final control structure associated with each terminal is
     the _l_t_c_h_a_r_s structure which defines control characters for
     the new terminal driver.  Its structure is:

     ssttrruucctt llttcchhaarrss {{
	  cchhaarr tt__ssuussppcc;;  //** ssttoopp pprroocceessss ssiiggnnaall **//

     }};;

     The default values for these characters are ^Z, ^Y, ^R, ^O,
     ^W, and ^V.  A value of -1 disables the character.

     The applicable _i_o_c_t_l functions are:

     TIOCSLTC	 _a_r_g is a pointer to an _l_t_c_h_a_r_s structure which
		 defines the new local special characters.

     TIOCGLTC	 _a_r_g is a pointer to an _l_t_c_h_a_r_s structure into
		 which is placed the current set of local special
		 characters.

     _W_i_n_d_o_w/_t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _s_i_z_e_s

     Each terminal has provision for storage of the current ter-
     minal or window size in a _w_i_n_s_i_z_e structure, with format:

     ssttrruucctt wwiinnssiizzee {{

     A value of 0 in any field is interpreted as ``undefined;''
     the entire structure is zeroed on final close.
