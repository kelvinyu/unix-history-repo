     CLTP is a simple, unreliable datagram protocol which is
     accessed via the SOCK_DGRAM abstraction for the ISO protocol
     family.  CLTP sockets are connectionless, and are normally
     used with the _s_e_n_d_t_o and _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m calls, though the _c_o_n_-
     _n_e_c_t(2) call may also be used to fix the destination for
     future packets (in which case the _r_e_c_v(2) or _r_e_a_d(2) and
     _s_e_n_d(2) or _w_r_i_t_e(_2) system calls may be used).

     CLTP address formats are identical to those used by TP.  In
     particular CLTP provides a service selector in addition to
     the normal ISO NSAP.  Note that the CLTP selector space is
     separate from the TP selector space (i.e. a CLTP selector
     may not be "connected" to a TP selector).

     Options at the CLNP network level may be used with CLTP; see
     _c_l_n_p(4).

     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors
     returned:

     [EISCONN]	    when trying to establish a connection on a
		    socket which already has one, or when trying
		    to send a datagram with the destination
		    address specified and the socket is already
		    connected;

     [ENOTCONN]     when trying to send a datagram, but no desti-
		    nation address is specified, and the socket
		    hasn't been connected;

     [ENOBUFS]	    when the system runs out of memory for an
		    internal data structure;

     [EADDRINUSE]   when an attempt is made to create a socket
		    with a selector which has already been allo-
		    cated;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		    when an attempt is made to create a socket
		    with a network address for which no network
		    interface exists.
