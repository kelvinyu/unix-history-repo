     The _d_r driver provides access to an Ikon DR-11W DMA con-
     troller.  Each minor device is a different controller.

     In addition to reading and writing, the following _i_o_c_t_l
     requests are available:

     DRWAIT    Wait for an attention interrupt from the associ-
	       ated device.

     DRPIOW    Write to the programmed i/o register.

     DRPACL    Write to the pulse register.

     DRDACL    Set the ``ac-low'' bit in the next command sent to
	       the DR-11W.

     DRPCYL    Set the ``cycle'' bit in the next command sent to
	       the DR-11W.

     DRDFCN    Hold the function bits until the next command is
	       issused.

     DRRATN    Reset the attention flag.

     DRRDMA    Reset the DMA complete flag.

     DRSFCN    Set the function bits in the control status regis-
	       ter and, as a side effect, clear the interrupt
	       enable flag.

     DRRPER    Reset the parity error flag.

     DRSETRSTALL
	       Set ``no stall'' mode for all subsequent reads.
	       In no stall mode the driver will abort read
	       requests that fail to complete before a user
	       specified timeout expires.

     DRSETNORSTALL
	       Disable no stall mode for reads.

     DRGETRSTALL
	       Return true if in no stall mode for reads.

     DRSETRTIMEOUT

	       Set the value of the timeout used in no stall mode
	       for reads.  The time is specified in tenths of
	       seconds.

     DRGETRTIMEOUT
	       Return the time until (in tenths of seconds)
	       before a read is timed out when in no stall mode.

     DRSETWSTALL
	       Set ``no stall'' mode for all subsequent writes.
	       In no stall mode the driver will abort write
	       requests that fail to complete before a user
	       specified timeout expires.

     DRSETNOWSTALL
	       Disable no stall mode for writes.

     DRGETWSTALL
	       Return true if in no stall mode for writes.

     DRSETWTIMEOUT
	       Set the value of the timeout used in no stall mode
	       for writes.  The time is specified in tenths of
	       seconds.

     DRGETRTIMEOUT
	       Return the time until (in tenths of seconds)
	       before a write is timed out when in no stall mode.

     DRWRITEREADY
	       Return 1 if the device can accept data, 0 other-
	       wise (this is areally the DR-11W A status bit).

     DRREADREADY
	       Return 1 if the device has data for the host to
	       read, 0 otherwise (this is really the DR-11W B
	       status bit).

     DRBUSY    Return 1  if the device is busy, 0 otherwise.

     DRRESET   Reset the DR-11W.

     DR11STAT  Return the driver status and the contents of the
	       DR-11W i/o registers.  The eight words returned
	       are, in order, the driver status flags, the con-
	       tents of the control status register, the contents
	       of the status register at the time of the last
	       interrupt from the device, the contents of the
	       programmed i/o data register, a combination of the
	       address modifier used by the device in performing
	       VERSAbus transfers and the interrupt vector used
	       by the device, the contents of the range register,

	       the contents of the rahi register, and the con-
	       tents of the ralo register.

     DR11LOOP  Perform loopback testing (the loopback cable must
	       be in place for this to work).
