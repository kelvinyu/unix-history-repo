     Hewlett-Packard's Remote Maintenance Protocol family is a
     collection of protocols layered atop _I_E_E_E _8_0_2._3. The current
     implementation of the RMP family provides protocol support
     only for the SOCK_RAW socket type.  As a result, sendto(2)
     and recvfrom(2) must be used to send and receive RMP pack-
     ets.

     The format of an RMP packet is defined in the include file
     <_n_e_t_r_m_p/_r_m_p__v_a_r._h>.  The RMP packet arrives encapsulated in
     an (HP extended) _I_E_E_E _8_0_2._2 packet.  The _I_E_E_E _8_0_2._2 packet
     is preceded by the kernel address of an _i_f_n_e_t _s_t_r_u_c_t which
     is used to `route' a packet out the same interface it
     arrived on.  Outgoing packets are encapsulated in a standard
     _I_E_E_E _8_0_2._3 packet, while incoming packets have this informa-
     tion stripped away.

     RMP (IEEE 802.3) addresses are 6 octets in length (48
     bytes).  Sockets in the Remote Maintenance Protocol family
     use the following addressing structure:

     struct sockaddr_rmp {
	  short          srmp_family;
	  u_char	 srmp_dhost[6];
     };

     The RMP protocol family supported by the operating system is
     currently comprised of the Boot Protocol
     (_p_r_o_t_o=_R_M_P_P_R_O_T_O__B_O_O_T). Unfortunately, we have no documenta-
     tion on the Remote Maintenance Protocol and only sketchy
     information about the Boot Protocol.

BBUUGGSS
     - The HP ROM uses IEEE 802.3 (as opposed to Ethernet) pack-
       ets.  While the kernel heuristically recognizes these
       packets, a more general mechanism for doing so should be
       provided.

     - The HP ROM uses a multicast address when first trying to
       locate boot servers.  While the Ethernet [sic] board is
       programmed to recognize this particular multicast address
       (9:0:9:0:0:4), a more general mechanism for doing so
       should be provided.

     - The kernel supports only RAW sockets for the RMP protocol.
       This is either a bug or a feature, since the kernel is
       smaller at the price of greater complexity in the server.

     - There is no support for bind(2)'ing an address in the RMP
       domain.	Something like an RMPADDR_ANY should be provided
       to prevent more than one _r_b_o_o_t_d server from running at the
       same time.
