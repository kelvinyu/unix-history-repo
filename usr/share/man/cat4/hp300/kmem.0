     _M_e_m is a special file that is an image of the main memory of
     the computer.  It may be used, for example, to examine (and
     even to patch) the system.

     Byte addresses in _m_e_m are interpreted as physical memory
     addresses.  References to non-existent locations cause
     errors to be returned.  On the HP300, the last byte of phy-
     sical memory is always 0xFFFFFFFF.  Hence, on an HP300 with
     8Mb of memory, physical memory would start at 0xFF800000.

     The file _k_m_e_m is the same as _m_e_m except that kernel virtual
     memory rather than physical memory is accessed.  Only kernel
     virtual addresses that are mapped to memory are allowed.  On
     the HP300, kernel virtual memory runs from 0 to about
     0x2400000.
