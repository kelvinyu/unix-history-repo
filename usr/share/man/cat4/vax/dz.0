     A DZ11 provides 8 communication lines with partial modem
     control, adequate for UNIX dialup use.  Each line attached
     to the DZ11 communications multiplexer behaves as described
     in _t_t_y(4) and may be set to run at any of 16 speeds; see
     _t_t_y(4) for the encoding.

     Bit _i of flags may be specified for a dz to say that a line
     is not properly connected, and that the line should be
     treated as hard-wired with carrier always present.  Thus
     specifying ``flags 0x04'' in the specification of dz0 would
     cause line tty02 to be treated in this way.

     The _d_z driver monitors the rate of input on each board, and
     switches between the use of character-at-a-time interrupts
     and input silos.  While the silo is enabled during periods
     of high-speed input, the driver polls for input 30 times per
     second.

     before it could be serviced.  This can happen if a hard
     error occurs when the CPU is running with elevated priority,
     as the system will then print a message on the console with
     interrupts disabled.  It is not serious.
