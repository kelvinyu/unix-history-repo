     The ts-11 combination provides a standard tape drive inter-
     face as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  The ts-11 operates only at
     1600 bpi, and only one transport is possible per controller.

     ttss%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     ttss%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     tape at block _b_n; status register 0 is printed in octal and
     symbolically decoded as bits.

BBUUGGSS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.

     The device lives at the same address as a tm-11 _t_m(4); as it
     is very difficult to get this device to interrupt, a generic
     system assumes that a ts is present whenever no tm-11 exists
     but the csr responds and a ts-11 is configured.  This does
     no harm as long as a non-existent ts-11 is not accessed.
