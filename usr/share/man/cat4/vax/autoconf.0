     When UNIX bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine on
     which it is running and locates controllers, drives, and
     other devices, printing out what it finds on the console.
     This procedure is driven by a system configuration table
     which is processed by _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) and compiled into each ker-
     nel.

     On the VAX, devices in NEXUS slots are normally noted, thus
     memory controllers, UNIBUS and MASSBUS adaptors.  Devices
     which are not supported which are found in NEXUS slots are
     noted also.  The Q-bus on the MICROVAX is configured in the
     same way as the UNIBUS.

     MASSBUS devices are located by a very deterministic pro-
     cedure since MASSBUS space is completely probe-able.  If
     devices exist which are not configured they will be silently
     ignored; if devices exist of unsupported type they will be
     noted.

     UNIBUS devices are located by probing to see if their
     control-status registers respond.	If not, they are silently
     ignored.  If the control status register responds but the
     device cannot be made to interrupt, a diagnostic warning
     will be printed on the console and the device will not be
     available to the system.

     Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded
     as the root filesystem.  If that is not possible, a generic
     system will pick its root device as the ``best'' available
     device (MASSBUS disks are better than SMD UNIBUS disks are
     better than RK07's; the device must be drive 0 to be con-
     sidered).	If such a system is booted with the RB_ASKNAME
     option (see _r_e_b_o_o_t(2)), then the name of the root device is
     read from the console terminal at boot time, and any avail-
     able device may be used.

     on the machine than were declared in the machine configura-

     a NEXUS, for which UNIX does not have a driver.

     in the sense that UNIX does not know how to poll it for ECC
     errors.

     found on the MASSBUS; for disks %s%d will look like ``hp0'',
     for tape formatters like ``ht1''.	The drive number comes
     from the unit plug on the drive or in the TM formatter (nnoott
     on the tape drive; see below).

     look like ``tu0 at ht0 slave 0'', where ttuu00 is the name for
     the tape device and hhtt00 is the name for the formatter.  A
     tape slave was found on the tape formatter at the indicated
     drive number (on the front of the tape drive).  UNIX will
     call the device, e.g., ttuu00.
