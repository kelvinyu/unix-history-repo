     IInnddxxbbiibb builds an inverted index to the named _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_s (or files), which
     can then be used by llooookkbbiibb and refer(1).  The files are assumed to be
     refer style bibliographic databases (see addbib(1)).

     IInnddxxbbiibb is a shell script which calls mmkkeeyy and iinnvv. The first program,
     mmkkeeyy, truncates words to 6 characters, and maps upper case to lower case.
     It also discards words shorter than 3 characters, words among the 100
     most common English words, and numbers (dates) < 1900 or > 2000.  These
     parameters can be changed; see page 4 of a _R_e_f_e_r document by Mike Lesk
     (See the SEE ALSO section below).  The second program, iinnvv, creates an
     entry file (_f_i_l_e.ia), a posting file (_f_i_l_e.ib), and a tag file (_f_i_l_e.ic),
     all in the working directory.

     LLooookkbbiibb uses an inverted index made by iinnddxxbbiibb to find sets of biblio-
     graphic references.  It reads keywords typed after the ``>'' prompt on
     the terminal, and retrieves records containing all these keywords.  If
     nothing matches, nothing is returned except another ``>'' prompt.

     LLooookkbbiibb will ask if you need instructions, and will print some brief in-
     formation if you reply ``y''.  The --nn flag turns off the prompt for in-
     structions.

     It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they have a com-
     mon index made by iinnddxxbbiibb. In that case, only the first argument given to
     iinnddxxbbiibb is specified to llooookkbbiibb.

     If llooookkbbiibb does not find the index files (the _f_i_l_e.i[abc] files), it
     looks for a reference file with the same name as the argument, without
     the suffixes.  It creates a file with a `.ig' suffix, suitable for use
     with fgrep(1).  It then uses this fgrep file to find references.  This
     method is simpler to use, but the _f_i_l_eig is slower to use than the
     _f_i_l_e.i[abc] files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference
     files.

     *.ia               Entry file.
     *.ib               Posting file.
     *.ic               Tag file.
     *.ig               Ascii file created if index files not found.
     /usr/libexec/mkey  Make keys program.
     /usr/libexec/inv   Hash and invert program.

BBUUGGSS
     More than one blank line in between citations can wreak havoc.

     Probably all dates should be indexed, since many disciplines refer to
     literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
