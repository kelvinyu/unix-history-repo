     The pprr utility is a printing and pagination filter.  If multiple input
     files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written to standard
     output.  By default, the input is separated into pages, each with a head-
     er that includes the page number, date, time, and the file's pathname.
     Text columns are of equal width, with at least one <blank> separation be-
     tween text columns.  Lines that do not fit into a text column are trun-
     cated.  If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic mes-
     sages are suppressed until the pprr utility has completed processing.

     The following options are available:

     ++_p_a_g_e       Begin output at page number page of the formatted input.

     --_c_o_l_u_m_n     Produce output that is columns wide (default is 1) and is in
                 text column rank order.  This option should not be used with
                 --mm. When used with --tt, use the minimum number of lines to
                 display the output.

     --ff          Use <form-feed> character for new pages, instead of the de-
                 fault behavior that uses a sequence of <newline> characters.
                 Prior to displaying the first page of output an <alert> char-
                 acter is written to standard output.

     --hh_h_e_a_d_e_r    Use the string header as the header to be printed instead of
                 file.

     --ll_l_i_n_e_s     Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to
                 lines.  If lines is smaller than the sum of both the header
                 and trailer depths (in lines), the pprr utility suppresses both
                 the header and trailer, as if the --tt option were in effect.

     --mm          Merge files.  Standard output is formatted so the pprr utility
                 writes one line from each file specified by a file operand,
                 side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in
                 terms of the number of column positions.

     --ss_c_h_a_r      Separate text columns by the single character char instead of
                 by the appropriate number of <space>s (default for char is
                 the <tab> character).

     --tt          Print neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-
                 line trailer usually supplied for each page.  Quit printing
                 after the last line of each file without spacing to the end
                 of the page.

     --ww_w_i_d_t_h     Set the width of the line to width column positions for mul-
                 tiple text-column output only (default is 72).

     The following operands are available:

     _f_i_l_e        A pathname of a file to be printed.

     If no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is `--', the stan-
     dard input is used.


     The standard input is used only if no file operands are specified, or if
     a file operand is `--'.

     If pprr receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it flushes all
     accumulated error messages to the screen before terminating.

     The pprr utility output is a paginated version of the original file (or
     files).  This pagination is optionally done using <form-feed>s or a se-
     quence of <newline>s.  Page headers are generated unless the --tt option is
     specified.

     The pprr utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Error messages are written to standard error during the printing process
     (if output is redirected) or after all successful file printing is com-
     plete (when printing to a terminal).

     The pprr function is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
