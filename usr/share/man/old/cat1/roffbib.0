     RRooffffbbiibb is a shell script which prints out all records in a bibliographic
     database, in bibliography format rather than as footnotes or endnotes.
     Generally it is used in conjunction with sortbib:

           sortbib database | roffbib

     RRooffffbbiibb accepts most of the options understood by nroff(1),  such as the
     --TT flag to specify terminal type.

     If abstracts or comments are entered in the database following the %%XX
     field key, rrooffffbbiibb will format them into paragraphs for an annotated bib-
     liography.  Several %%XX fields may be given if several annotation para-
     graphs are desired.

     Options exclusive to rrooffffbbiibb:

     --xx          Suppresses the printing of %%XX abstracts.

     --VV          Send output to the Versatec (use vtroff).

     --QQ          Queue the output to the default troff device.

     If neither the --QQ or --VV flags are given, rrooffffbbiibb sends the output to the
     standard output.  The default macros for rrooffffbbiibb are in
     _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_t_m_a_c_/_t_m_a_c_._b_i_b. These can be over ridden by specifying a user-
     defined set with the --mm option.

     Four command-line registers control formatting style of the bibliography,
     much like the number registers of ms(7).  The command-line argument --rr_N_1
     will number the references starting at one  1 .  The flag --rr_V_2 will dou-
     ble space the bibliography, while --rr_V_1 will double space references but
     single space annotation paragraphs.  The line length can be changed from
     the default 6.5 inches to 6 inches with the --rr_L_6_i argument, and the page
     offset can be set from the default of 0 to one inch by specifying --rr_O_1_i
     (capital O, not zero).  Note: with the --VV and --QQ flags the default page
     offset is already one inch.

     RRooffffbbiibb is limited, but it is a good script to copy and adopt for one's
     own needs, as it does demonstrate usage of refer(1).
