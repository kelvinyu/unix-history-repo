     EEyyaacccc is an old version of yacc(1), which produces tables used by the
     Pascal system and its error recovery routines.  EEyyaacccc fully enumerates
     test actions in its parser when an error token is in the look-ahead set.
     This prevents the parser from making undesirable reductions when an error
     occurs before the error is detected.  The table format is different in
     eeyyaacccc than it was in the old yacc(1), as minor changes had been made for
     efficiency reasons.

     Pc(1) and its error recovery routines should be made into a library of
     routines for the new yacc(1).
