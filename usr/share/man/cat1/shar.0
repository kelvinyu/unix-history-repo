     _S_h_a_r writes an _s_h(1) shell script to the standard output
     which will recreate the file hierarchy specified by the com-
     mand line operands.  Directories will be recreated and must
     be specified before the files they contain.

     _S_h_a_r is normally used for distributing small numbers of
     files by _f_t_p(1) or _m_a_i_l(1).

BBUUGGSS
     _S_h_a_r makes no provisions for special types of files or files
     containing magic characters.

     It is easy to insert trojan horses into _s_h_a_r files.  It is
     strongly recommended that all shell archive files be exam-
     ined before running them through _s_h(1).  Archives produced
     using this implementation of _s_h_a_r may be easily examined
     with the command:

	  grep -v '^X' program.shar

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a shell archive of the program _l_s(1) and mail it
     to Rick:

	  cd ls
	  shar `find . -print` | mail -s "ls source" rick

     To recreate the program directory:

	  mkdir ls
	  cd ls
	  <delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
	  sh archive
