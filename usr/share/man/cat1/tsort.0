     _T_s_o_r_t takes a list of pairs of node names representing
     directed arcs in a graph and prints the nodes in topological
     order on standard output.	Input is taken from the named
     file, or from standard input if no file is given.

     Node names in the input are separated by white space and
     there must be an even number of nodes.

     Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc
     from the node to itself.  This is useful when a node is not
     connected to any other nodes.

     If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be prop-
     erly sorted), one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and
     the sort continues.  Cycles are reported on standard error.
