     The join utility performs an ``equality join'' on the files _f_i_l_e_1 and
     _f_i_l_e_2.  The joined files are written to the standard output.

     The ``join field'' is a field in each file on which the files are com-
     pared.  There is one line in the output for each pair of lines in _f_i_l_e_1
     and _f_i_l_e_2 which have identical join fields.  The output line by default
     consists of the join field, then the remaining fields from _f_i_l_e_1, then
     the remaining fields from _f_i_l_e_2.  This format can be changed by using the
     --oo option (see below).

     The files file1 and file2 should be ordered in the collating sequence of
     sort -b on the fields on which they are to be joined, by default the
     first in each line; Otherwise, all join field matches need not be report-
     ed.

     The default input field separators are <blank>s.  In this case, multiple
     separators count as one field separator, and leading separators are ig-
     nored.  The default output field separator is a <space>.

     The following options are available:

     --aa _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r
	       In addition to the default output, produce a line for each
	       unpairable line in file _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r, where _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r is 1 or
	       2.

     --ee _s_t_r_i_n_g
	       Replace empty output fields by the string _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --jj _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r _f_i_e_l_d
	       Join on the _f_i_e_l_d'th field of file _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r.	If _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r
	       is missing, (i.e., the first digit of the option argument is
	       neither 1 nor 2), use the _f_i_e_l_d'th field in each file.  Fields
	       are decimal integers starting with 1.

     --oo _l_i_s_t   Each output line comprises the fields specified in _l_i_s_t, each
	       element of which has the form `file_number.field', where
	       _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r is a file number and field is a decimal integer
	       field number.  The elements of list are either comma or <space>
	       separated.  The list is written only for lines with matching
	       join fields, and is not output unless specifically requested.

     --tt _c_h_a_r   Use character _c_h_a_r as a separator, for both input and output.
	       Every appearance of char in a line is significant.  When this
	       option is specified, the collating sequence should be the same
	       as sort without the --bb option.

     --vv _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r
	       Instead of the default output, produce a line only for each
	       unpairable line in _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r, where _f_i_l_e__n_u_m_b_e_r is 1 or 2.

     --11 _f_i_e_l_d
	       Join on the _f_i_e_l_d'th field of file 1.  Fields are decimal
	       integers starting with 1.

     --22 _f_i_e_l_d
	       Join on the _f_i_e_l_d'th field of file 2.  Fields are decimal
	       integers starting with 1.

     If both `-a 1' and `-a 2' are specified, both sets of information are
     output, `-a 2' always first, regardless of the specified order.

     The following arguments are required:

     _f_i_l_e_1
     _f_i_l_e_2     A pathname of a file to be joined.  If either of the _f_i_l_e_1 or
	       _f_i_l_e_2 arguments is `--' the standard input is used in its place.


     The jjooiinn utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The jjooiinn function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.

BBUUGGSS
     The conventions of jjooiinn join(1), comm(1), sort(1), uniq(1), look(1) and
     awk(1) are wildly incongruous.
