     DDff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the speci-
     fied _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m or on the filesystem of which _f_i_l_e is a part.  Values are
     displayed in 512-byte per block block counts.  If neither a file or a
     filesystem operand is specified, statistics for all mounted filesystems
     are displayed (subject to the --tt option below).

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Include statistics on the number of free inodes.

     --nn      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesys-
             tems.  This option should be used if it is possible that one or
             more filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able
             to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this option is
             specified, ddff will not request new statistics from the filesys-
             tems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics that
             were previously obtained.

     --tt      Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
             The recognized types are: ufs, nfs, mfs, lfs, pc, fdesc, portal
             and kernfs, along with the aggregates: all (the default), local
             (ufs, mfs, lfs), and misc (fdesc, portal, kernfs).  The string
             ``no'' may be prepending to a type to get its complement (e.g.
             ``nonfs'' to get non-NFS filesystems).  The first --tt option over-
             rides the default, additional such options will add to (or sub-
             tract from) the current set of types; e.g. either ``df -t ufs -t
             lfs'' or ``df -t local -t nomfs'' will display statistics for UFS
             and LFS filesystems.

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environmental variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                counts will be displayed in units of that size block.

     The --nn and --tt flags are ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
