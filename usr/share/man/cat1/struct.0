       _S_t_r_u_c_t  translates  the  Fortran program specified by _f_i_l_e
       (standard input default) into a Ratfor program.   Wherever
       possible,  Ratfor  control constructs replace the original
       Fortran.  Statement numbers appear only where still neces-
       sary.   Cosmetic changes are made, including changing Hol-
       lerith strings into quoted strings and  relational  opera-
       tors  into symbols (.e.g. ".GT." into ">").  The output is
       appropriately indented.

       The following options may occur in any order.

       --ss     Input is accepted in standard  format,  i.e.   com-
              ments  are  specified  by a c, C, or * in column 1,
              and continuation lines are specified by a  nonzero,
              nonblank  character in column 6.  Normally input is
              in the form accepted by _f_7_7(1)

       --ii     Do not turn computed goto statements into switches.
              (Ratfor  does  not turn switches back into computed
              goto statements.)

       --aa     Turn sequences of else ifs into a non-Ratfor switch
              of the form

              switch
                   { case pred1: code
                     case pred2: code
                     case pred3: code
                     default: code
                   }

              The  case  predicates are tested in order; the code
              appropriate to only one  case  is  executed.   This
              generalized form of switch statement does not occur
              in Ratfor.

       --bb     Generate goto's instead of multilevel break  state-
              ments.

       --nn     Generate  goto's  instead of multilevel next state-
              ments.

       --tt_n    Make the nonzero integer _n the lowest valued  label
              in the output program (default 10).

       --cc_n    Increment  successive  labels in the output program
              by the nonzero integer _n (default 1).

       --ee_n    If _n is 0 (default), place code within a loop  only
              if  it  can lead to an iteration of the loop.  If _n
              is nonzero, admit a small code segments to  a  loop
              if  otherwise  the loop would have exits to several
              places including the segment, and the  segment  can
              be  reached  only  from the loop.  `Small' is close
              to, but not equal to, the number of  statements  in
              the  code  segment.   Values of n under 10 are sug-
              gested.

       Struct knows Fortran 66 syntax, but not full Fortran 77.
       If an input Fortran program contains identifiers which are
       reserved  words  in  Ratfor, the structured version of the
       program will not be a valid Ratfor program.
       The labels generated cannot go above 32767.
       If you get a goto without a target, try --ee ..
