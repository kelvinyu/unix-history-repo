     _V_i_s is a filter for converting non-printable characters into
     a visual representation.  It differs from cat -v in that the
     form is unique and invertible.  By default, all non-graphic
     characters except space, tab, and newline are encoded.  A
     detailed description of the various visual formats is given
     in vis(3).

     -c   Request a format which displays a small subset of the
	  non-printable characters using C-style backslash
	  sequences.

     -o   Request a format which displays non-printable charac-
	  ters as an octal number, \ddd.

     -t   Tabs are also encoded.

     -w   White space (space-tab-newline) is also encoded.

     -s   Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal
	  are encoded.	This flag allows backspace, bell, and
	  carriage return in addition to the default space, tab
	  and newline.

     -f   and

     -F   Causes vviiss to fold output lines to foldwidth columns
	  (default 80), like fold(1), except that a hidden new-
	  line sequence is used, (which is removed when inverting
	  the file back to its original form with unvis(1)).  If
	  the last character in the encoded file does not end in
	  a newline, a hidden newline sequence is appended to the
	  output.  This makes the output usuable with various
	  editors and other utilities which typically don't work
	  with partial lines.

     -n   Turns off any encoding, except for the fact that
	  backslashes are still doubled and hidden newline
	  sequences inserted if -f or -F is selected.  When com-
	  bined with the -f flag, vis becomes like an invertible
	  version of the fold(1) utility.  That is, the output
	  can be unfolded by running the output through unvis(1).

     -b   Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow con-
	  trol sequences and Meta characters, and disables the

	  doubling of backslashes.  This produces output which is
	  neither invertible or precise, but does represent a
	  minimum of change to the input.  It is similar to cat
	  -v.

     -l   Mark newlines with the visable sequence '\$', followed
	  by the newline.
