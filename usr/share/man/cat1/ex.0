     EExx is the root of a family of editors: eeddiitt, eexx and vvii.  EExx is a superset
     of ed, with the most notable extension being a display editing facility.
     Display based editing is the focus of vi(1).

     If you have not used ed(1), or are a casual user, you will find that the
     editor eeddiitt is convenient for you.  It avoids some of the complexities of
     eexx used mostly by systems programmers and persons very familiar with
     ed(1).

     If you have a CRT terminal, you may wish to use a display based editor;
     in this case see vi(1), which is a command which focuses on the display
     editing portion of eexx.

     The document _E_d_i_t: _A _t_u_t_o_r_i_a_l (USD:14) provides a comprehensive introduc-
     tion to eeddiitt assuming no previous knowledge of computers or the UNIX sys-
     tem.

     The _E_x _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l - _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _3._7 (USD:16) is a comprehensive and
     complete manual for the command mode features of eexx, but you cannot learn
     to use the editor by reading it.  For an introduction to more advanced
     forms of editing using the command mode of eexx see the editing documents
     written by Brian Kernighan for the editor ed(1); the material in the in-
     troductory and advanced documents works also with eexx.

     display editor vi(1) and provides reference material on vi(1).  In addi-
     tion, the _V_i _Q_u_i_c_k _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e card summarizes the commands of vi(1) in a
     useful, functional way, and is useful with the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n.

     EExx appeared in 3 BSD.

     Originally written by William Joy
     Mark Horton has maintained the editor since version 2.7, adding macros,
     support for many unusual terminals, and other features such as word ab-
     breviation mode.

     The uunnddoo command causes all marks to be lost on lines changed and then
     restored if the marked lines were changed.

     UUnnddoo never clears the buffer modified condition.

     The zz command prints a number of logical rather than physical lines.
     More than a screen full of output may result if long lines are present.

     File input/output errors don't print a name if the command line `--'
     option is used.

     There is no easy way to do a single scan ignoring case.

     The editor does not warn if text is placed in named buffers and not used
     before exiting the editor.

     Null characters are discarded in input files, and cannot appear in
     resultant files.
