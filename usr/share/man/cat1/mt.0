     MMtt is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.  If a tape name is
     not specified, the environment variable TAPE is used;  if TAPE does not
     exist, mmtt uses the device /_d_e_v/_r_m_t_1_2.  Note that _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e must reference
     a raw (not block) tape device.  By default mmtt performs the requested
     operation once.  Operations may be performed multiple times by specifying
     _c_o_u_n_t.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many characters as are
     required to uniquely identify a command need be specified.

     eeooff, wweeooff
	       Write _c_o_u_n_t end-of-file marks at the current position on the
	       tape.

     ffssff       Forward space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     ffssrr       Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     bbssff       Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     bbssrr       Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     rreewwiinndd    Rewind the tape (Count is ignored).

     oofffflliinnee, rreewwooffffll
	       Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (Count is ig-
	       nored).

     ssttaattuuss    Print status information about the tape unit.

     MMtt returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful, 1 if
     the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.

     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by mmtt.

     TAPE      MMtt checks the TAPE environment variable if the argument
	       _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e is not given.
