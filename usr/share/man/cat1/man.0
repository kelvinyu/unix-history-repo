     _M_a_n displays the UNIX manual pages entitled _n_a_m_e.

     The options are as follows:

     a	  Display all of the manual pages for a specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
	  and _n_a_m_e combination.  (Normally, only the first manual
	  page found is displayed.)

     c	  Copy the manual page to the standard output instead of
	  using _m_o_r_e(1) to paginate it.  This is done by default
	  if the standard output is not a terminal device.

     M	  Override the list of standard directories which _m_a_n
	  searches for manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a
	  colon (``:'') separated list of directories.	This
	  search path may also be set using the environment vari-
	  able _M_A_N_P_A_T_H.  The subdirectories to be searched as
	  well as their search order is specified by the ``_sub-
	  dir'' line in the _m_a_n configuration file.

     m	  Augment the list of standard directories which _m_a_n
	  searches for manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a
	  colon (``:'') separated list of directories.	These
	  directories will be searched before the standard direc-
	  tories or the directories specified using the _M option
	  or the _M_A_N_P_A_T_H environment variable.

     _w	  List the pathnames of the manual pages which _m_a_n would
	  display for the specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n and _n_a_m_e combination.

     The optional _s_e_c_t_i_o_n restricts the directories that _m_a_n will
     search.  The _m_a_n configuration file (see _m_a_n__c_o_n_f(5)) speci-
     fies the possible _s_e_c_t_i_o_n values that are currently avail-
     able.  If only a single argument is specified or if the
     first argument is not a valid section, _m_a_n assumes that the
     argument is the name of a manual page to be displayed.

     MACHINE
	  As some manual pages are intended only for use on cer-
	  tain architectures, _m_a_n searches certain directories
	  applicable to the current machine.  _M_a_n'_s determination
	  of the current machine type may be overridden by set-
	  ting the environment variable MACHINE to the name of an
	  architecture (see _m_a_c_h_i_n_e(1)).  Machine specific areas

	  are checked before general areas.

     MANPATH
	  The standard search path used by _m_a_n may be overridden
	  by specifying a path in the MANPATH environment vari-
	  able.  The format of the path is a colon (``:'')
	  separated list of directories.  The subdirectories to
	  be searched as well as their search order is specified
	  by the ``_subdir'' line in the _m_a_n configuration file.

     PAGER
	  Any value of the environment variable _P_A_G_E_R will be
	  used instead of the standard pagination program
	  _m_o_r_e(1).

     The on-line manual pages are, by necessity, forgiving toward
     stupid display devices, causing some manual pages to not be
     as good as their typeset counterparts.
