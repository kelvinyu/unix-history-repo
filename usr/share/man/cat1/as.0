     The aass assembler produces an object file from the given source files or
     from the standard input.

     --aa        Specifies the alignment _v_a_l_u_e of procedures and data blocks.
	       It is given as a power of two; thus an alignment of 3 causes
	       alignment on an eight byte boundary.  The default is --aa2, the
	       minumum value is 1, the maximum value 16.

     --dd        Displacement offset in bytes for displacement values not de-
	       fined in the first pass or unspecified in the assembly
	       language.  Possible values are 1, 2, or 4.  The default is --dd4,
	       if --dd is not given.

     --LL        Save defined labels beginning with a ``L'', which are normally
	       discarded to save space in the resultant symbol table.  The
	       compilers generate such temporary labels.

     --VV        Use virtual memory for some intermediate storage, rather than a
	       temporary file.

     --WW        Do not complain about errors.

     --JJ        Use long branches to resolve jumps when byte-displacement
	       branches are insufficient.  This must be used when a compiler-
	       generated assembly contains branches of more than 32k bytes.

     --RR        Make initialized data segments read-only, by concatenating them
	       to the text segments.  This obviates the need to run editor
	       scripts on assembly code to make initialized data read-only and
	       shared.

     --tt        Specifies a directory to receive the temporary file, other than
	       the default /tmp.

     Symbols remaining undefined upon completion are assumed global

     Output is either placed in _o_u_t_f_i_l_e, if given, or sent placed in _a._o_u_t.

     AAss appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The version decsribed here is
     derived from Version 7 AT&T aass.

BBUUGGSS
     --JJ should be eliminated; the assembler should automatically choose among
     byte, word and long branches.
