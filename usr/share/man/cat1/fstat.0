     _F_s_t_a_t identifies open files.  A file is considered open if a
     process has it open, if it is the working directory for a
     process, or if it is an active pure text file.  If no
     options are specified, _f_s_t_a_t reports on all open files.

     Options:

     --uu    Report all files open by the specified user.

     --pp    Report all files open by the specified process.

     ffiilleennaammee......
	   Restrict reports to the specified files.  If the file
	   is a block special file, _f_s_t_a_t additionally reports on
	   any open files on that device, treating it as a
	   mounted file system.

     The following fields are printed:

     UUSSEERR  The username of the owner of the process.

     CCMMDD   The command name of the process.

     PPIIDD   The process id.

     FFDD    The file number in the per-process open file table.
	   The special names ``text'' and ``wd'' mean that the
	   file is the pure text inode or the working directory
	   for the process.  If the file number is followed by an
	   asterisk (``*''), then the file is not an inode, but
	   is a socket or a FIFO or has an error of some kind.
	   In this case the rest of the entry is in variable for-
	   mat, doesn't correspond to the rest of the headings,
	   and is enclosed in parentheses.  If the file resides
	   on a remote filesystem, the device, inode, and size
	   fields are replaced by the text ``from remote filesys-
	   tem''.

     DDEEVVIICCEE
	   Major/minor number of the device this file exists on.

     IINNOODDEE The inode number of the file.

     SSIIZZEE  The size, in bytes, of the file.

     TTYYPPEE  The type of the file (see _s_t_a_t(2)).

     The formating of open sockets depends on the protocol
     domain.  In all cases the first field is the domain name,
     the second field is the socket type (stream, dgram, etc),
     and the third is the socket flags field (in hex).	The
     remaining fields are protocol dependent.  For tcp, it is the
     address of the tcpcb, and for udp, the inpcb (socket pcb).
     For unix domain sockets, its the address of the socket pcb
     and the address of the connected pcb (if connected).  Other-
     wise the protocol number and address of the socket itself
     are printed.  The attempt is to not duplicate _n_e_t_s_t_a_t(1),
     but rather to make enough information available to permit
     further analysis.

     For example, the addresses mentioned above are the addresses
     which the ``netstat -A'' command would print for tcp, udp,
     and unixdomain.  Note that since pipes are implemented using
     sockets, a pipe appears as a connected unix domain stream
     socket.  A unidirectional unix domain socket indicates the
     direction of flow with an arrow (``<-'' or ``->''), and a
     full duplex socket shows a double arrow (``<->'').

     Since _f_s_t_a_t takes a snapshot of the system, it is only
     correct for a very short period of time.
