     _S_h_o_w_m_o_u_n_t shows status information about the NFS server on
     _h_o_s_t. By default it prints the names of all hosts that have
     NFS file systems mounted on the host. See "NFS: Network File
     System Protocol Specification, RFC1094, Appendix A" for a
     detailed desciption of the protocol.

     --aa   List all mount points in the form:
	       _h_o_s_t:_d_i_r_p_a_t_h

     --dd   List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts

BBUUGGSS
     The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of
     the actual mounts, since the NFS server is stateless.
     Showmount will only display the information as accurately as
     the mount daemon reports it.
