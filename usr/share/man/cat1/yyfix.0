     yyfix - extract tables from y.tab.c

     Programs have historically used a script (often named
     ``:yyfix'') to extract tables from the _y_a_c_c generated file
     ``y.tab.c''.  As the names of the tables generated by the
     current version of _y_a_c_c are different from those of histori-
     cal versions of _y_a_c_c, the shell script _y_y_f_i_x is provided to
     simplify the transition.

     The first, required, argument to _y_y_f_i_x is the name of the
     file where the extracted tables should be stored.

     If further command line arguments are specified, they are
     taken as the list of tables to be extracted.  Otherwise,
     _y_y_f_i_x attempts to determine if the ``y.tab.c'' file is from
     an old or new _y_a_c_c, and extracts the appropriate tables.

     The tables ``yyexca'', ``yyact'', ``yypact'', ``yypgo'',
     ``yyr1'', ``yyr2'', ``yychk'', and ``yydef'' are extracted
     from historical versions of _y_a_c_c.

     The tables ``yylhs'', ``yylen'', ``yydefred'', ``yydgoto'',
     ``yysindex'', ``yyrindex'', ``yygindex'', ``yytable'',
     ``yyname'', ``yyrule'' and ``yycheck'' are extracted from
     the current version of _y_a_c_c.
