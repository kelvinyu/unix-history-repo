     dddd - Convert and copy a file.

     The dddd utility copies the specified input file to the specified output
     with possible conversions.

     The following options are available:

     iiff==_f_i_l_e   Input pathname; standard input is default.

     ooff==_f_i_l_e   Output pathname; standard output is default.

     iibbss==_n     Input block size _n bytes (default is 512 bytes).

     oobbss==_n     Output block size (default is 512 bytes).

     bbss==_n      Set both input and output block size, superseding iibbss and oobbss.

     ccbbss==_n     Conversion buffer size

     sskkiipp==_n    Skip _n input blocks (each block is the size of iibbss) before
	       starting copy.

     sseeeekk==_n    Seek n blocks (each block is the size of obs) from beginning of
	       output file before copying.

     ccoouunntt==_n   Copy only _n input blocks.

     ccoonnvv==_v_a_l_u_e[_v_a_l_u_e ...]
	       Where values are comma-separated symbols from the following
	       list.

	       bblloocckk	 Convert variable length records to fixed length.
			 Read characters into the ccbbss buffer, delete a trail-
			 ing <newline>, and pad to the length of the ccbbss
			 buffer with <space>s.	bblloocckk and uunnbblloocckk are mutually
			 exclusive.

	       uunnbblloocckk	 Convert fixed length records to variable length.
			 Read a number of characters equal to the size of the
			 ccbbss buffer, delete all trailing <blank>s, and append
			 a <newline>.

	       llccaassee	 Map characters in the alpha character classification
			 from class upper to the corresponding value in class
			 lower.  llccaassee and uuccaassee are mutually exclusive.

	       uuccaassee	 Map characters in the alpha character classification
			 from class lower to the corresponding value in class
			 upper.

	       sswwaabb	 Swap every pair of bytes

	       nnooeerrrroorr	 Do not stop processing on an error.

	       ssyynncc	 Pad every input block to the size of iibbss buffer, ap-
			 pending <space> characters.

     Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.	A size
     can end with kk or bb to specify multiplication by 1024 or 512, respective-
     ly.  A pair of sizes can be separated by xx to indicate a product.
     If the option iiff== is not specified, the standard input is used.

     The input files can be any file type and on completion, dddd writes the
     number of input and output blocks, full and partial counts, to the stan-
     dard error.

     A partial block may be caused by a read or write operation transferring
     less than iibbss bytes.  Only bytes read have conversions, as specified by
     the options, applied to them.

     For SIGINT, the dddd utility writes status information to standard error
     before exiting.  It takes the default action for all other signals.

     The dddd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     If an error is detected, and the noerror option has not been supplied,
     the cause is reported and the dddd utility aborts the copy of the file.

     The dddd function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
