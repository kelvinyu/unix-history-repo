     _T_p_u_t makes terminal-dependent information available to users
     or shell applications.  The options are as follows:

     -T   The terminal name as specified in the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p database,
	  for example, ``vt100'' or ``xterm''.	If not specified,
	  _t_p_u_t retrieves the ``TERM'' variable from the environ-
	  ment.

     _T_p_u_t outputs a string if the _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e is of type string; a
     number if it is of type integer.  Otherwise, _t_p_u_t exits 0 if
     the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
     without further action.

     The following special attributes are available:

     clear
	  Clear the screen (the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p ``cl'' sequence).

     init
	  Initialize the terminal (the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p ``is'' sequence).

     longname
	  Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.

     reset
	  Reset the terminal (the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p ``rs'' sequence).

     The exit value of _t_p_u_t is based on the last attribute speci-
     fied.  If the attribute is of type string or of type
     integer, _t_p_u_t exits 0 if the attribute is defined for this
     terminal type and 1 if it is not.	If the attribute is of
     type boolean, _t_p_u_t exits 0 if the terminal has this attri-
     bute, and 1 if it does not.  _T_p_u_t exits 2 if any error
     occurred.

BBUUGGSS
     _T_p_u_t can't really distinguish between different types of
     attributes.  This is due to the limited interface in the
     current version of _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(3), and will be fixed in the near
     future.
