     The ccaatt utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The _f_i_l_e operands are processed in command line order.  A single
     dash represents standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb    Implies the --nn option but doesn't number blank lines.

     --ee    Implies the --vv option, and displays a dollar sign (``$'') at the
	   end of each line as well.

     --nn    Number the _o_u_t_p_u_t lines, starting at 1.

     --ss    Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
	   single spaced.

     --tt    Implies the --vv option, and displays tab characters as ``^I'' as
	   well.

     --uu    The --uu option guarantees that the output is unbuffered.

     --vv    Displays non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control
	   characters print line ``^X'' for control-X; the delete character
	   (octal 0177) prints as ``^?''.  Non-ascii characters (with the high
	   bit set) are printed as `.`M-'' (for meta) followed by the charac-
	   ter for the low 7 bits.

     CCaatt is useful for getting files into a pipe, for instance, to sort two
     files together, the command

	   cat file1 file2 | sort > sfile

     reads the contents of file1 and file2 sequentially, pipes it all to sort
     and places the newly sorted data in file3.

     Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output redirec-
     tion, the command ``cat file1 file 2 > file1'' will cause

     CCaatt The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
