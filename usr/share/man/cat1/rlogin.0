     RRllooggiinn starts a terminal session on a remote host _h_o_s_t.

     RRllooggiinn first attempts to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism,
     described below.  If the remote host does not supporting Kerberos the
     standard Berkeley _r_h_o_s_t_s authorization mechanism is used.	The options
     are as follows:

     --88        The --88 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
	       otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote
	       side's stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q.  Eight-
	       bit mode is the default.

     --KK        The --KK option turns off all Kerberos authentication.

     --LL        The --LL option allows the rlogin session to be run in ``litout''
	       (see tty(4)) mode.

     --dd        The --dd option turns on socket debugging (see setsockopt(2)) on
	       the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.

     --ee        By default, the tilde (``~'') character is the escape charac-
	       ter.  The --ee option allows specification of a different escape
	       character.

     --kk        The option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote
	       host in realm _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as
	       determined by krb_realmofhost(3).

     --xx        The --xx option turns on DES encryption for all data passed via
	       the rlogin session.  This may impact response time and CPU
	       utilization, but provides increased security.

     A line of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host, where ``~''
     is the escape character.  Similarly, the line ``~^Z'' will suspend the
     rrllooggiinn session.  Substitution of the delayed-suspend character (normally
     ^Y) for the suspend character suspends the send portion of the rlogin,
     but allows output from the remote system.

     All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
     the rrllooggiinn is transparent.  Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input
     and output on interrupts are handled properly.

     Each user may have a private authorization list in the file ._k_l_o_g_i_n in
     their home directory.  Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
     principal name of the form _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e@_r_e_a_l_m.  If the originating
     user is authenticated to one of the principals named in ._k_l_o_g_i_n, access
     is granted to the account.  The principal _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_n_a_m_e.@_l_o_c_a_l_r_e_a_l_m is
     granted access if there is no ._k_l_o_g_i_n file.  Otherwise a login and pass-
     word will be prompted for on the remote machine as in login(1).  To avoid
     certain security problems, the ._k_l_o_g_i_n file must be owned by the remote
     user.

     If Kerberos authentication fails, a warning message is printed and the
     standard Berkeley _r_l_o_g_i_n is used instead.

     RRllooggiinn appeared in 4.2 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     RRllooggiinn will be replaced by telnet(1) in the near future.

     More of the environment should be propagated.
