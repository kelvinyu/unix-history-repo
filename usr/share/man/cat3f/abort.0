       _A_b_o_r_t cleans up the I/O buffers and then terminates execu-
       tion.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is given, it is written to logical unit 0
       preceded by ``abort:''.

       If the --gg flag was specified during loading,  then  execu-
       tion  is terminated by calling _a_b_o_r_t (3) which aborts pro-
       ducing a _c_o_r_e file in the current directory.   If  --gg  was
       not specified while loading, then _*_*_* _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e_d
       is written on logical unit 0 and execution is  terminated.

       If  the _f_7_7___d_u_m_p___f_l_a_g environment variable has been set to
       a value which begins with _y, _a_b_o_r_t (3) is  called  whether
       or not --gg was specified during loading.  Similarly, if the
       value of _f_7_7___d_u_m_p___f_l_a_g begins with _n, _a_b_o_r_t is not called.
