     The _s_t_r_t_o_d function converts the initial portion of the
     string pointed to by _n_p_t_r to _d_o_u_b_l_e representation.

     The expected form of the string is an optional plus (``+'')
     or minus sign (``-''), followed by a sequence of digits
     optionally containing a decimal-point character, optionally
     followed by an exponent.  An exponent consists of an ``E''
     or ``e'', followed by an optional plus or minus sign, fol-
     lowed by a sequence of digits.

     Leading white-space characters in the string (as defined by
     the _i_s_s_p_a_c_e(3) function) are skipped.

     The _s_t_r_t_o_d function returns the converted value, if any.

     If _e_n_d_p_t_r is not NULL, a pointer to the character after the
     last character used in the conversion is stored in the loca-
     tion referenced by _e_n_d_p_t_r.

     If no conversion is performed, zero is returned and the
     value of _n_p_t_r is stored in the location referenced by
     _e_n_d_p_t_r.

     If the correct value would cause overflow, plus or minus
     _H_U_G_E__V_A_L is returned (according to the sign of the value),
     and _E_R_A_N_G_E is stored in _e_r_r_n_o.  If the correct value would
     cause underflow, zero is returned and _E_R_A_N_G_E is stored in
     _e_r_r_n_o.
