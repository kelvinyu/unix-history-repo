.sh CONCLUSIONS
We have presented sample VAX systems over a wide performance range
using both all-DEC and the best available second vendor equipment,
emphasizing, independently, minimal cost and maximal expandability.
Use this information wisely; price shouldn't always be the bottom line.
.LP
Consider the all-DEC system if you can afford it.
If not, the second-vendor equipment in the packages here is all
thought to work well
on VAX hardware.  You can reliably build and operate such a system.
When you have struggled through your particular set of difficulties and
are up and on the uucp network, be sure and write us about your experiences.
Good luck!
