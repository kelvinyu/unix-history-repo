Stare hershey font.  This font is identical to the hershey font
except that the point sizes are one point smaller, and the width
tables are those used for the real typesetter.  Hence, this font
is useful when previewing documents that are to be sent to a typesetter
to make sure the spacing, paging, and so on is right.
There are Roman, \f2Italic\f1 and \f3Bold\f1
in 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 point.
The following examples are 10 point.

If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be,
as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality; since, as he elsewhere
tells us, lost time is never found again; and what we call time enough,
always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing
to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity.
