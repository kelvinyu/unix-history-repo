                   Data Structure Access




     The following functions allow one to create and manipu-
late  the  various  types of lisp data structures.  Refer to
1.3 for details of the data structures known to FRANZ LISP.





(*array 's_name 's_type 'x_dim1 ... x_dim_n)

     WHERE:   s_type may be one of t, nil,  fixnum,  flonum,
              fixnum-block and flonum-block.

     RETURNS: an array of type s_type with n  dimensions  of
              extents given by the x_dim_i.

     SIDE EFFECT: If s_name is non nil, the function defini-
                  tion  of s_name is set to the array struc-
                  ture returned.

     NOTE: The *_a_r_r_a_y function creates a Maclisp  compatible
           array.   Arrays  are  fully  described  in 9.  In
           FRANZ LISP arrays of type t, nil, fixnum and flo-
           num  are  equivalent  and  the  elements of these
           arrays can be any type of lisp  object.   Fixnum-
           block  and  flonum-block arrays are restricted to
           fixnums and flonums  respectively  and  are  used
           mainly to communicate with foreign functions (see
           8.4).


(aexplode 's_arg)

     RETURNS: a list of single character symbols which _p_r_i_n_t
              would use to print out g_arg, that is the list
              returned will contain  quoting  characters  if
              _p_r_i_n_t would have used them to print s_arg.

     NOTE: this is restricted to symbols and is  mainly  for
           use by explode.

(aexplodec 's_arg)

     RETURNS: a list of symbols whose pnames are the charac-
              ters in s_arg's pname.


(aexploden 's_arg)

     RETURNS: a list of fixnums which represent the  charac-
              ters of s_arg's pname.

(alphalessp 'st_arg1 'st_arg2)

     RETURNS: t iff the `name' of st_arg1 is  alphabetically
              less  than the name of st_arg2. If st_arg is a
              symbol than its `name' is its print name.   If
              st_arg  is  a  string,  then its `name' is the
              string itself.


(append 'l_arg1 'l_arg2)

     RETURNS: a list containing the elements of l_arg1  fol-
              lowed by l_arg2.

     NOTE: To generate the result, the top level list  cells
           of  l_arg1 are duplicated and the cdr of the last
           list cell is set to point to l_arg2.   Thus  this
           is  an  expensive  operation  if l_arg1 is large.
           See the description of nconc for a cheaper way of
           doing the append.

     RETURNS: a list like l_arg1 with  g_arg2  as  the  last
              element.

     NOTE: this  is  equivalent  to  (append  'l_arg1  (list
           'g_arg2)).

(array s_name s_type x_dim1 ... x_dim_i)

     NOTE: this is the same as *array except  the  arguments
           are not evaluated.


(arraycall s_type 'as_array 'x_ind1 ... )

     RETURNS: the element selected by  the indicies from the
              array a_array of type s_type.

     NOTE: if as_array is a symbol then the function binding
           of this symbol should contain an array object.
           s_type is ignored by _a_r_r_a_y_c_a_l_l  but  is  included
           for compatibility with Maclisp.


(arraydims 's_name)

     RETURNS: a list of the type and  bounds  of  the  array
              s_name.

(arrayp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is of type array.


(arrayref 'a_name 'x_ind)

     RETURNS: the  x_ind_t_h  element  of  the  array   object
              a_name.  x_ind of zero accesses the first ele-
              ment.

(ascii x_charnum)

     WHERE:   x_charnum is between 0 and 255.

     RETURNS: a symbol whose print name is the single  char-
              acter    whose    fixnum   representation   is
              x_charnum.


(assoc 'g_arg1 'l_arg2)

     RETURNS: the first top level element  of  l_arg2  whose
              _c_a_r is _e_q_u_a_l to g_arg1.

     NOTE: the test is make with the  lisp  function  equal.
           Usually l_arg2 has an _a-_l_i_s_t structure and g_arg1
           acts as key.


(assq 'g_arg1 'l_arg2)

     RETURNS: the first top level element  of  l_arg2  whose
              _c_a_r is equal to g_arg1 using the lisp function
              _e_q.

     NOTE: This is faster than assoc since eq is faster than
           equal  but lisp objects which print alike are not
           always _e_q.  See the description of  eq  for  more
           details.

(atom 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is not a list or hunk object.

     NOTE: (atom '()) returns t.


(bcdad 's_funcname)

     RETURNS: a fixnum which is the address in memory  where
              the function s_funcname begins.  If s_funcname
              is not a machine coded function (binary)  then

(bcdp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is a data object of type binary.

     NOTE: the name of this function is a throwback  to  the
           PDP-11 Lisp system.


(bigp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is a bignum.


(c..r 'lh_arg)

     WHERE:   the .. represents any positive number  of  a's
              and d's.

     RETURNS: the result of accessing the list structure  in
              the  way determined by the function name.  The
              a's and d's are read from right to left,  a  _d
              directing  the access down the cdr part of the
              list cell and an _a down the car part.

     NOTE: lh_arg may also be nil, and it is guaranteed that
           the car and cdr of nil is nil.
           Currently one may dissect hunks and bignums  with
           c..r as well although this is subject to change.


(concat ['stn_arg1 ... ])

     RETURNS: a symbol whose print name  is  the  result  of
              concatenating  the print names, string charac-
              ters  or  numerical  representations  of   the
              sn_arg_i.

     NOTE: If no arguments are given, a symbol with  a  null
           pname  is  returned.   Concat  places  the symbol
           created on the oblist, the function uconcat  does
           the  same thing but does not place the new symbol
           on the oblist.

     EXAMPLE: (_c_o_n_c_a_t '_a_b_c (_a_d_d _3 _4) "_d_e_f") ==> abc7def

(cons 'g_arg1 'g_arg2)

     RETURNS: a new list cell whose car is g_arg1 and  whose
              cdr is g_arg2.


(copy 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: A structure _e_q_u_a_l to g_arg but with  new  list
              cells.


(copysymbol 's_arg 'g_pred)

     RETURNS: an uninterned symbol with the same print  name
              as  s_arg.   If  g_pred  is  non nil, then the
              value, function binding and property  list  of
              the new symbol are made _e_q to those of s_arg.


(cpy1 'xvt_arg)

     RETURNS: a new cell of the same type  as  xvt_arg  with
              the same value as xvt_arg.


(cxr 'x_ind 'h_hunk)

     RETURNS: element x_ind (starting at 0) of hunk h_hunk.


(defprop ls_name g_val g_ind)

     RETURNS: g_val.

     SIDE EFFECT: The property list of ls_name is updated by
                  adding  g_val  as  the  value of indicator
                  g_ind.

     NOTE: this is similar to putprop except that the  argu-
           ments  to defprop are not evaluated.  ls_name may
           be a disembodied property list, see _g_e_t.

              level of l_list no more than x_count times.

     NOTE: x_count defaults to a very large number, thus  if
           x_count is not given, all occurances of g_val are
           removed from the top level of l_list.   g_val  is
           compared  with  successive  _c_a_r's of l_list using
           the function _e_q_u_a_l.

     SIDE EFFECT: l_list is modified using  rplacd,  no  new
                  list cells are used.

     RETURNS: the result of  splicing  g_val  from  the  top
              level of l_list no more than x_count times.

     NOTE: _d_e_l_q is the same as _d_e_l_e_t_e except that _e_q is used
           for comparison instead of _e_q_u_a_l.

     RETURNS: a list of single character symbols which _p_r_i_n_t
              would use to print g_arg.


(explodec 'g_val)

     RETURNS: the list of characters which print  would  use
              to  print g_val except that special characters
              in symbols are not escaped (just as  if  patom

     RETURNS: a new uninterned atom beginning with the first
              character  of  s_leader's  pname, or beginning
              with g if s_leader is not given.

     NOTE: The  symbol  looks  like  x0nnnnn  where   x   is
           s_leader's  first  character  and  nnnnn  is  the

     NOTE: If there is no indicator g_ind in ls_name's  pro-
           perty list nil is returned.  If ls_name is a list
           of an odd number of elements then it is a  disem-
           bodied  property list. _g_e_t searches a disembodied
           property list by  starting at its _c_d_r and looking
           at every other element for g_ind.

     NOTE: This looks in the running lisp's symbol table for
           a symbol with the same name as s_entry_i.  It then

(replace 'g_arg1 'g_arg2)

     WHERE:   g_arg1 and g_arg2 must be  the  same  type  of
              lispval and not symbols or hunks.

     RETURNS: g_arg2.

     SIDE EFFECT: The effect of _r_e_p_l_a_c_e is dependent on  the
                  type  of  the  g_arg_i  although  one  will
                  notice a similarity in  the  effects.   To
                  understand what _r_e_p_l_a_c_e does to fixnum and
                  flonum arguments you must first understand
                  that  such  numbers  are  `boxed' in FRANZ
                  LISP.  What this means is that if the sym-
                  bol  x  has  a value 32412, then in memory
                  the value element of x's symbol  structure
                  contains  the  address  of another word of
                  memory (called a box) with  32412  in  it.
                  Thus  there  are  two ways of changing the
                  value of x, one is  to  change  the  value
                  element  of  x's symbol structure to point
                  to a  word  of  memory  with  a  different
                  value.  Another way is to change the value
                  in the box which x points to.  The  former
                  method is used almost all of the time, the
                  latter is used very  rarely  and  has  the
                  potential  to  cause great confusion.  The
                  function _r_e_p_l_a_c_e  allows  you  to  do  the
                  latter,  that  is  to  actually change the
                  value in the box.  You  should  watch  out
                  for   these   situations.    If   you   do
                  (_s_e_t_q _y _x) then both  x and y  will  point
                  to    the    same   box.    If   you   now
                  (_r_e_p_l_a_c_e _x _1_2_3_4_5) then y  will  also  have
                  the value 12345.  And in fact there may be
                  many other pointers to that box.   Another
                  problem  with  replacing  fixnums  is that
                  some boxes are  read  only.   The  fixnums
                  between  -1024  and  1023  are stored in a
                  read only area  and  attempts  to  replace
                  them  will  result  in  an "Illegal memory
                  reference" error (see the  description  of
                  _c_o_p_y_i_n_t*  for a way around this problem)..
                  For the other valid types, the  effect  of
                  _r_e_p_l_a_c_e is easy to understand.  The fields
                  of g_val1's structure are made eq  to  the
                  corresponding  fields  of  g_val2's struc-
                  ture.  For example,  if  x   and   y  have
                  lists   as   values  then  the  effect  of

                  (_r_e_p_l_a_c_e _x _y)    is    the     same     as
                  (_r_p_l_a_c_a _x (_c_a_r _y)) and (_r_p_l_a_c_d _x (_c_d_r _y)).


(reverse 'l_arg)

     RETURNS: the reverse of the list l_arg.

     NOTE: The _r_e_v_e_r_s_e is performed by allocating  new  list
           cells  to  duplicate the top level of l_arg. This
           can be expensive if l_arg is large.  The function
           nreverse will reverse the list without allocating
           new list cells.


(rplaca 'lh_arg1 'g_arg2)

     RETURNS: the modified lh_arg1.

     SIDE EFFECT: the car of lh_arg1 is set to  g_arg2.   If
                  lh_arg1  is a hunk then the second element
                  of the hunk is set to g_arg2.


(rplacd 'lh_arg1 'g_arg2)

     RETURNS: the modified lh_arg1.

     SIDE EFFECT: the cdr of lh_arg2 is set to  g_arg2.   If
                  lh_arg1  is  a hunk then the first element
                  of the hunk is set to g_arg2.


(rplacx 'x_ind 'h_hunk 'g_val)

     RETURNS: h_hunk

     SIDE EFFECT: Element x_ind (starting at 0) of h_hunk is
                  set to g_val.


(*rplacx 'x_ind 'h_hunk 'g_val)

     RETURNS: h_hunk

     SIDE EFFECT: Element x_ind (starting at 0) of h_hunk is
                  set to g_val.

     NOTE: This is the same as _r_p_l_a_c_x except you may replace
           uninitialized  hunk  entries.  This is only to be
           used by functions such as _h_u_n_k and _m_a_k_h_u_n_k  which
           create  hunks  of  sizes  which are not powers of
           two.

              (_c_o_n_d ((_a_s_s_o_c '_g__a_r_g '_l__a_r_g_2) (_a_p_p_l_y '_s_l__f_u_n_c _n_i_l)))

     NOTE: sassoc is written as a macro.


(sassq 'g_arg1 'l_arg2 'sl_func)

     RETURNS: the                 result                  of
              (_c_o_n_d ((_a_s_s_q '_g__a_r_g '_l__a_r_g_2) (_a_p_p_l_y '_s_l__f_u_n_c _n_i_l)))

     NOTE: sassq is written as a macro.


(set 's_arg1 'g_arg2)

     RETURNS: g_arg2.

     SIDE EFFECT: the value of s_arg1 is set to g_arg2.


(setplist 's_atm 'l_plist)

     RETURNS: l_plist.

     SIDE EFFECT: the property  list  of  s_atm  is  set  to
                  l_plist.


(setq s_atm1 'g_val1 [ s_atm2 'g_val2 ... ... ])

     WHERE:   the arguments are  pairs  of  atom  names  and
              expressions.

     RETURNS: the last g_val_i.

     SIDE EFFECT: each s_atm_i  is  set  to  have  the  value
                  g_val_i.

(stringp 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: t iff g_arg is a string.


(substring 'st_name 'x_start ['x_length])

     RETURNS: the string of length at most  x_length  begin-
              ning at character x_start of st_name.

     NOTE: If st_name is a symbol, its print name  is  used.
           x_start selects the first character of the string
           to return.  If x_start is 1, then the first char-
           acter  of  st_name is selected.  If x_start is -1
           then the last character of st_name  is  selected.
           If  the  magnitude of x_start is greater than the
           length of the st_name, then nil is returned.   If
           x_length  is not given or is less than zero, then
           infinity is assumed.


(substringn 'st_name 'x_start ['x_length])

     RETURNS: the fixnum  representation  of  the  character
              string  of length  x_length beginning at posi-
              tion x_start in the string st_name.

     NOTE: If st_name is a symbol, then its  print  name  is
           used.   x_start selects the character in the same
           way as in _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g.  A fixnum representation  of
           a  character  string  is  a  list  of  the fixnum
           equivalents of the characters.   If  x_length  is
           not  given  or  is negative, infinity is assumed.
           If x_length is 0 then the result is the  same  as
           if  x_length  were  1 except the single fixnum is
           returned instead of putting it in a list.


(symbolp 'g_arg)

(type 'g_arg)

     RETURNS: a symbol whose pname  describes  the  type  of
              g_arg.


(typep 'g_arg)

     EQUIVALENT TO: type.


(uconcat ['s_arg1 ... ])

     RETURNS: a symbol whose pname is  the  result  of  con-
              catenating  the  print  names  (pnames) of the
              s_arg_i.

     NOTE: If no arguments are given, a symbol with  a  null
           pname  is  returned.   _u_c_o_n_c_a_t does not place the
           symbol created on the oblist, the function concat
           does the same thing but does place the new symbol
