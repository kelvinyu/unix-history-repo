Ok, so we're getting closer on putting this all together, and I think
that's great.

However, I'd like to note that we're already pretty tight on time if we're
going to make the March 1st release date (and I believe we should), given
some of the many intermediate milestones that we need to hit.

Assuming March 1st, the hard part is to now set down some of these more
critical intervening dates and do whatever we need to do to ensure
that we DO hit them.  If we fall down on our BETA test (I think ALPHA is
almost out of the question given the time we have), we won't have any hope
of making the 1 March target.

I'll take this opportunity to fire off a set of hypothetical dates which
we can then wrangle over and hopefully ratify.

Additionally, it's now a good time to start listing the desired features
and make some realistic time estimates for each one to be completed.
Please add your items to this list and then we can add 'em up and
see which ones for which we have a chance of doing in time, and for which
we don't have a hope in hell.

PLANNED FEATURES AND BUG FIXES LIST

Feature/Fix				Est Completion Date	Who	Detail
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ shared lib/debugging support	10 Jan 1994		JKH	[1]
Shared libraries			05 Jan 1994		JKH
/usr/ports cleanup			25 Jan 1994		ALL	[2]
Integration of `nvi' from K. Bostic	28 Jan 1994		JKH	[3]
texinfo added to std distribution	15 Jan 1994		JKH	[4]

.. (add your own entries here) ..



Detail
------

[1]  Shared C++ libs require /usr/lib/crt1.so target installed, and selective
     dependency on same.  Shared libg++ requires merging with shared curses
     library for now (may be different ways of doing this, investigating).

[2]  ports collection requires thinning, rational makefiles, and other changes
     required to bring into line with /usr/ports/CHECKLIST document.  Everyone
     _must_ pitch in on this or ports will remain in disarray!

[3]  Keith Bostic's nvi is nearing first release date.  If stable, will
     replace elvis.

[4]  Several ports require makeinfo, info is already on its way to becoming
     documentation format of choice (options.texi being one example), and
     having a default info reader in /usr/bin/info would be a very nice
     enabling technology for doing more online docs in info format.

"Enforcement":

Once we've ratified it, we should check a copy of this file into
/usr/src somewhere so that it will be more publically accessible
during the development cycle.  If you put something on this list,
expect periodic mail saying "how's it going?  Ahem." as your due-date
draws near.  If you _don't_ put something you want on the list,
then you should both not expect to see it in, and you should expect
massive hate-mail (and its possible removal) if you come trundling
along and suddenly commit it without warning.

Does all this sound reasonable to everyone?
