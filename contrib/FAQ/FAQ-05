5.0 Misc Questions
------------------

5.0.1:	I've heard of something called FreeBSD-current.  How do I run it, and
	where can I get more information?

Read the file /usr/src/contrib/FAQ/OTHER-FAQS/FreeBSD.current.policy, it
will tell you all you need to know.


5.0.2:	What is this thing called `sup', and how do I use it?

SUP stands for Software Update Protocol, and was developed by CMU for
keeping their development trees in sync.  We use it to keep remote sites
in sync with our central development sources.

To use it, you need to have direct internet connectivity (not just
mail or news).  First, pick up the sup_bin.tgz package from:

	freebsd.cdrom.com:/pub/FreeBSD/packages

Second, read the file /usr/src/contrib/FAQ/OTHER-FAQS/FreeBSD.sup.faq.

This file describes how to setup sup on your machine.  You may also
want to look at `/usr/src/contrib/FAQ/other/FreeBSD.*.supfile',
which are a set of supfiles for supping from freefall.cdrom.com
