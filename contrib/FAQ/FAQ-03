3.0 Commercial Applications
---------------------------

Note:  This section is still very sparse, though we're hoping, of course,
that companies will add to it! :)  The FreeBSD group has no ties with any
of the companies listed here but simply lists them as a public service
(and feels that commercial interest in FreeBSD can have very positive
effects on FreeBSD's long-term viability).  We encourage commercial software
vendors to send their entries here for inclusion.


3.0.1	Where can I get Motif for FreeBSD?

Sequoia Communications provides commercial quality Motif 1.2.3
development kits for FreeBSD 1.1 (with full shared library support).
Due to licensing restrictions from the OSF, and the fact that Sequoia
needs to make a living, these are NOT FREE, but nonetheless quite reasonably
priced in comparison to many other commercial Motif distributions.  Send
electronic mail to `info@seq.com' for further information.
>>>> please make sure this is correct! 

3.0.8	What about other commercial quality development systems for FreeBSD?

ParcPlace Systems, Inc. provides their excellent "Object Interface & Object
Builder" GUI development environment free of charge to FreeBSD users.  Using
OI, you can develop Motif or OpenLook compliant applications in C++ with all
the benefits of a true GUI object hierarchy.  This will be announced and
made available as part of the FreeBSD distribution very soon.
