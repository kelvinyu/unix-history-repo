This is my first try to integrate linux's 387 emulator into NetBSD.

Files:	README - this file
	npx_h.dif - a diff to /sys/arch/i386/include/npx.h
	file.i386.add - add this to files.i386
	fpem.tar - untar from /sys/arch/i386/i386, it will create a dir
		   named fpemul.

Changes:
	in npx.h the padding in the save87 struct had to be increased to 
	the size of the i387_union in the emulator. This diff
	may be made to be #ifdef MATH_EMULATE as a space saver.
	Also instead of the magic number it would be nicer to calculate
	it with some sizeof's. 
	I removed that ifndef dontdef, that was crazy!

	For changes in the emulator itself se the Changelog file
	there. That some 40 files that the emulator is, may be cat-ed
	together if this bothers someone, and if someone is willing to do.

	When adding the files to files.i386 don't forget to uncomment
	the old emulator - math_emulate.c -.

testing:
	Since i don't have (yet) that deep knowledge in the NetBSD 
	internals, it is possible thet something really stupid has been
	done. Nevertheless, my system looks ok. (it's a 2 week old
	current) i have ran some simple tests, they did work. Someone
	should try paranoia.
	Speed increases from 1.5 up to 8 times have been measured.

	It's worth noting that i did *not* look inside the actulal math
	routines, nor i know how they work, but i think those have been 
	well tested.


	Hope this helps.
