This is the New Linux math emulator as ported to NetBSD.
It runs fine and allows you to run programs such as ghostscript and other
floating point intensive programs.  Read the file README for more information
on this packages history.

To install run the program emu_install.  This program assumes that you
have your sources in the standard place. (/sys/*)
