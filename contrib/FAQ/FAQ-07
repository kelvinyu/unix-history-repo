7.0 System Administration
-------------------------

7.0.1:	How do I add a user easily?  I read the man page and am more confused
        than ever!  [Alternatively:  I didn't read the man page, I never read
	man pages! :-) ]

Look at Gary Clark's perl package "AddIt", which may be found in
/usr/src/share/FAQ/programs/AddIt-0.1B.tar.gz 


7.0.2: I'm trying to use my printer and keep running into problems.  I tried
        looking at /etc/printcap, but it's close to useless.  Any ideas?

Yes, you can pick up Andreas Klemm's apsfilter package from:

	ftp.germany.eu.net:~ftp/pub/comp/i386/Linux/Local.EUnet/People/akl/apsfilter-1.11.gz

This is a compleate package for printing text, PS and DVI files.  It
requires ghostscript and dvips.  For a smaller package where you just
want to print simple text files and postscript or just plain want a
simpler package, look in the file: /usr/src/share/FAQ/programs/printcap01.gz

This includes a printcap for a epson printer and a filter for postscript.

NOTE: We're looking for printcap entrys for all printers.  If you have
one, or a filter for one, please send it or mail us a pointer to
FreeBSD-FAQ@freefall.cdrom.com.  Thanks!
