Welcome to the FreeBSD 1.1 FAQ!  This document tries to answer some of
the most frequently asked questions about FreeBSD 1.1 (or later, unless
specifically indicated).  If there's something you're having trouble
with and you just don't see it here, then please send mail to:

	freebsd-questions@freefall.cdrom.com

Or, if it's a bug you wish to report, to:

	freebsd-bugs@freefall.cdrom.com

Some of the instructions here will also refer to auxilliary utilities
in the /usr/src/share/FAQ directory.  CDROM purchasers and net folks who've
grabbed the FreeBSD 1.1 `srcdist' will have these files.  If you don't have
the source distribution, then you can either grab the whole thing from:

	freebsd.cdrom.com:~ftp/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-1.1

Or you can grab only those files you're interested in straight out of the
FreeBSD-current distribution in:

	freebsd.cdrom.com:~ftp/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src

Thanks!
