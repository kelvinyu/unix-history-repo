8.0 Networking
--------------

8.0.1:	Where can I get information booting FreeBSD `diskless', that is
	booting and running a FreeBSD box from a server rather than having
	a local disk?

Look in the directory /src/sys/i386/netboot for the file netboot.doc.


8.0.2:	I've heard that you can use a FreeBSD box as a dedicated network
	router - is there any easy support for this?

After a fashion, yes.  There is a standard `router floppy' that you can
boot on a FreeBSD machine to configure it as a network router.  [>>>> put
pointer to router floppy image here ]


8.0.3:	Does FreeBSD support SLIP and PPP?

Yes.  See the man pages for slattach and/or pppd if you're using FreeBSD
to connect to another site.  If you're using FreeBSD as a server for other
machines, look at the man page for `sliplogin'.
