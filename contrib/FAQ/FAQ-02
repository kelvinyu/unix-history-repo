2.0 Hardware compatibility
--------------------------

2.0.1:	What kind of hard drives does FreeBSD run on?

FreeBSD supports MFM, RLL, ESDI, IDE and SCSI hard drives.


2.0.2:	What SCSI controllers are supported?

FreeBSD supports the following SCSI controllers:

Adaptec              AH-1542 Series (ISA>
                     AH-1742 Series <EISA>
Buslogic             BT-445 Series <VLB> (*)
                     BT-545 Series <ISA>
                     BT-742 Series <EISA>
UltraStor            UH-14f Series <ISA>
                     UH-34f Series <EISA>

There is supposed to be a UltraStor 24f driver floating around, but we're
not sure where (could someone please point us at it?).  Note that we do
NOT support `Future Domain' or `IN2000' SCSI controllers, typically
the little $50 specials you get with some CDROM drives.  You will have to
buy a more mainstream (and capable) SCSI controller.

(*)  See section 1.0.5.


2.0.3:	What CD-ROM drives are supported by FreeBSD?

Any SCSI drive connected to a supported controller.
Mitsumi LU002(8bit), LU005(16bit) and FX001D(16bit 2x Speed).

FreeBSD does NOT support drives connected to a Sound Blaster or non-SCSI
SONY or Panasonic drives.  A general rule of thumb when selecting a CDROM
drive for FreeBSD use is to buy a very standard SCSI model; they cost more,
but deliver very solid performance in return.  Do not be fooled by very cheap
Mitsumi solutions that, in turn, deliver VERY LOW performance!  As always,
you get what you pay for.


2.0.4:	What multi-port serial cards are supported by FreeBSD?

AST/4 and BOCA 4/8 port cards.  Some unnamed clone cards have also been
known to work, especially those that claim to be AST compatible.  Check
the man page for `sio' to get more information on configuring such cards.


2.0.5:	Does FreeBSD support the AHA-2742 SCSI adapter from Adaptec?

No, FreeBSD does not.  This is due to Adaptec's unwillingness to supply
programing information under other than non-disclosure.  This is unfortunate.

 
2.0.6:	I have a XXXX bus mouse.  Is it supported and if so, how do I set
	it up for XFree86?

FreeBSD supports the Logitech, ATI Inport and PS/2 bus mice.  You need to add
the following line to the kernel config file and recompile for the Logitech
and ATI mice:  

	device        mse0    at isa? port 0x23c tty irq6 vector mseintr


2.0.7:	I have a PS/2 mouse (`keyboard' mouse) [Alternatively:  I have a
	laptop with a trackball mouse].  How do I use it?

For the PS/2 mouse you need to look in /usr/src/share/FAQ/programs/psm.tar.z,
which is John Solhed's port of the Linux PS/2 mouse driver. 

Follow the directions in the package.  You will also need to change your
Xconfig file to point to the mouse.


2.0.8:	What types of tape drives are supported under FreeBSD?

FreeBSD supports SCSI, QIC-02 and QIC-40/80 (Floppy based) tape drives.
This includes Exabyte and DAT drives.


2.0.9:	What sound cards are supported by FreeBSD?

FreeBSD supports the SoundBlaster, SoundBlaster Pro, Pro Audio Spectrum 16,
AdLib and Gravis UltraSound sound cards. There is also limited support
for MPU-401 and compatible midi cards.  The SoundBlaster 16 and 
SoundBlaster 16 ASP cards are not yet supported.
NOTE:  This is only for sound!  This driver does not support CD-ROMs, SCSI
or joysticks on these cards.


2.0.10:	What network cards does FreeBSD support?

There is support for the following cards:
NE2000 and 1000
WD/SMC 8003,8013 and Elite Ultra (8216)
3Com 3c503 
And clones of the above
AT&T EN100/StarLAN 10
Isolan AT 4141-0
Isolink 4110
3com 3c509 (BETA)
