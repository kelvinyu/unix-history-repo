9.0 Communications
------------------

9.0.1: When I do a set line in kermit it locks up, whats the problem?

The problem here is that FreeBSD thinks it's talking to a incoming
modem connection, and is waiting for carrier to come up on it before
completing the open.  To disable modem control, do an:

	stty -f /dev/ttyXX clocal

(Where `ttyXX' is the tty port you're using).  If you use a given port
only for outgoing connections, you may wish to put this command in
your /etc/rc.local to avoid having to do it every time you reboot
your system.


NOTE:  Anyone wishing to submit a FAQ entry on how to get tip and cu working
       would have it much appreciated!  We all use kermit over here! :-)
