for

seconds, the default
.I interval
is 15 seconds.
.I Limit
can be given to limit the total running time of the
.I tra,
the default is effectively infinite.

.I Tra
normally copies out all the text currently in the file
before beginning to watch for new text.
The option

alone causes only new material to be given.

.I Tra
is particularly useful for alternately watching the output
file being written by a long shell script or a long-running
program and doing real work.
