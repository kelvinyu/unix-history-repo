This directory contains the source for pxp.
Many of the files here were linked to the same in the directory ../pi.
The links were broken by tp.  The a.out binary here can be installed
	
	install

This is all that should be necessary.

To make a pxp do		makepxp
To print a listing do		printpxp

The variable DEBUG can be defined allowing tracing of the error
recovery in the parser.
Look at the first line of "0.h" to see if DEBUG is defined.
A smaller pxp results if it is not.

Non-standard programs required to make a pxp

	cc		Version 7 C compiler, version 6 will not work
	eyacc		Need modified yacc distributed with pxp
	set time=3	Causes commands taking more than 3 seconds of
			processor time to be "timed" in a variant shell.
			You can comment out this line or do
				cp /dev/null set; chmod 755 set
			to avoid a "set: Not found" diagnostic.

I would like to know of any problems with pxp, or of any
local modifications which you find necessary or desirable.
