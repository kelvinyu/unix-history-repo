.Sh NAME
.Nm login.access
.Nd Login access control table
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm login.access
file specifies (user, host) combinations and/or (user, tty) 
combinations for which a login will be either accepted or refused.
.Pp
When someone logs in, the 
.Nm login.access
is scanned for the first entry that
matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will 
be accepted or refused.
.Pp
Each line of the login access control table has three fields separated by a
":" character:	  permission : users : origins

The first field should be a "+" (access granted) or "-" (access denied)
character. The second field should be a list of one or more login names
or wildcards.  The third field should be a list of one or more tty
names (for non-networked logins), host names, domain names (begin with
"."), host addresses, internet network numbers (end with ".") or
wildcards.
.Pp
The following wildcards are supported: ALL matches any string; LOCAL
matches any string that does not contain a "." character.
