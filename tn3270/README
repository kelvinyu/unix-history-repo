This is tn3270, version 4.1.  This version builds on 4.3 BSD Unix (and
various similar systems, including 4.2).

Files (and directories):

ANNOUNCE	A description of some newer functions
		in tn3270.

README		This file.

curses		The 4.3 curses package, which allows PUTCHAR to
		be defined (needed only if NOT43 is defined; see
		tn3270/makefile and tn3270/Make-samples) for the
		sun and vax computers.  These do NOT include the
		source for curses, just two .a files (in curses/sun
		and curses/vax).  Also included in this directory
		is the 4.3 curses.h file.  If one of the 4.3 curses
		.a files from this directory are used, this curses.h
		file must also be used during compilation of tn3270.

man		Contains man pages in man/man1 and man/man5.

telnet		The version of telnet which is used to build tn3270.

tn3270		The actual code for tn3270.  See the README file there
		for more information.  You should "cd" to tn3270 and
		say "make" to build tn3270.

transcom	An example of a transcom command driver; for using
		tektool on Suns.  This directory includes the man
		page entry for the comand driver (tk3270).


Thanks to various people at Berkeley for helping with this version of
tn3270, especially in the area of graphics.
