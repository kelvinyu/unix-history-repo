 * Phase-lock loop (PLL) definitions
 *
 * The following defines establish the performance envelope of the PLL.
 * They specify the maximum phase error (MAXPHASE), maximum frequency
 * error (MAXFREQ), minimum interval between updates (MINSEC) and
 * maximum interval between updates (MAXSEC). The intent of these bounds
 * is to force the PLL to operate within predefined limits in order to
 * satisfy correctness assertions. An excursion which exceeds these
 * bounds is clamped to the bound and operation proceeds accordingly. In
 * practice, this can occur only if something has failed or is operating
 * out of tolerance, but otherwise the PLL continues to operate in a
 * stable mode.
 *
 * MAXPHASE must be set greater than or equal to CLOCK.MAX (128 ms), as
 * defined in the NTP specification. CLOCK.MAX establishes the maximum
 * time offset allowed before the system time is reset, rather than
 * incrementally adjusted. Here, the maximum offset is clamped to
 * MAXPHASE only in order to prevent overflow errors due to defective
 * protocol implementations.
 *
 * MAXFREQ reflects the manufacturing frequency tolerance of the CPU
 * clock oscillator plus the maximum slew rate allowed by the protocol.
 * It should be set to at least the frequency tolerance of the
 * oscillator plus 100 ppm for vernier frequency adjustments. If the
 * kernel frequency discipline code is installed (PPS_SYNC), the CPU
 * oscillator frequency is disciplined to an external source, presumably
 * with negligible frequency error, and MAXFREQ can be reduced.

 * time_offset variable is used by the PLL to adjust the system time in
 * small increments. The time_constant variable determines the bandwidth
 * or "stiffness" of the PLL. The time_tolerance variable is the maximum
 * frequency error or tolerance of the CPU clock oscillator and is a
 * property of the architecture; however, in principle it could change
 * as result of the presence of external discipline signals, for
 * instance. The time_precision variable is usually equal to the kernel
 * tick variable; however, in cases where a precision clock counter or
 * external clock is available, the resolution can be much less than
 * this and depend on whether the external clock is working or not. The
 * time_maxerror variable is initialized by a ntp_adjtime() call and

 * bound growth. The time_esterror variable is set and read by the
