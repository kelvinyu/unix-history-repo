This tcp is believed to run on Sun-3/x systems running Sun OS v3.3,
Vax 7xx and CCI Tahoe systems running 4.3BSD, VAX VMS systems
running the most recent Wollongong WIN software and Gould systems
running ?? (contact dpk@brl.arpa for Gould details).  It should
run, unmodified, on any stock 4.2 or 4.3BSD machine.  Various
defines to account for system dependencies are at the front of
tcp_var.h.  If tcp won't work on your system, check the comments
in tcp_var.h to see if there's some obvious change you should
make.  If you have to tweak the configuration to make things
work on your machine, please let van@lbl-csam.arpa know.  We'd
like to make the public release of the code easy-to-install on
as many machines as possible.  That means that any notes you
can send us on installation problems will be invaluable.

The tcp* files in the netinet subdirectory are replacements for the
tcp* files of your 4.[23] distribution (i.e., they should replace the
tcp files in /sys/netinet).  "Makefile.sun" is a makefile to construct
tcp binaries on an object-only Sun system.  The "netstat" subdirectory
contains a modification to "netstat" to print out the new
tcp statistics.  It is a replacement for /usr/src/ucb/netstat/inet.c.
You will need source for your current version of netstat to make use of
this.  If you don't, be sure that OLDSTAT is defined in tcp_var.h
so that the old TCP statistics are available from netstat.  The remaining
source files for netstat are in the inet portion of this network
release, but these will work without modification only on 4.3BSD systems.
