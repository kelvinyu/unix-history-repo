NOTE! Check that there is no #define EXCLUDE_<cardname> lines for
      the cards you are configuring in the sound/local.h. Otherwise
      the low level driver for the card is not compiled in the kernel.

To enable sound card support, you need to uncomment and add one or more of 
the following lines to your kernel configuration file according to the
directions below:

#device snd5 at isa? port 0x330 irq 6 drq 0 vector mpuintr
#device snd4 at isa? port 0x220 irq 15 drq 6 vector gusintr
#device snd3 at isa? port 0x388 irq 10 drq 6 vector pasintr
#device snd2 at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 1 vector sbintr
#device snd6 at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 5 vector sbintr
#device snd7 at isa? port 0x300 irq 7 drq 0 vector sbintr
#device snd1 at isa? port 0x388 irq 0 drq 0 vector sbintr

       Unit numbers are:
                 1 for Yamaha FM synth
                 2 for SB/SB Pro DSP
                 3 for PAS PCM and Midi
                 4 for GUS
                 5 for MPU-401 (there is separate driver for the SB16)
                 6 for SB16 (DSP)
                 7 for SB16 Midi (MPU-401 emulation)

       If you have ProAudioSpectrum, uncomment units 3, 2 and 1
       If you have SoundBlaster 1.0 to 2.0 or SB Pro, uncomment 2 and 1.
       If you have SoundBlaster 16, uncomment 2, 1, 6 and 7.
       (use the same IRQ for the cards 2, 6 and 7. The DMA of the
       card 2 is the 8 bit one and the DMA of the card 6 is the 16 bit one.
       the port address of the card 7 is the Midi I/O address of the SB16.
       If you have GravisUltrasound, uncomment 4
       If you have MPU-401, uncomment 5

NOTE:  The MPU-401 driver may or may not work, and is unfortunately
unverifiable since no one I know has one.  If you can test this,
please let me know!  Also note that you will have to change these
settings if your soundcard is set for a non-standard address or IRQ.
Please check your documentation (or verify with any provided DOS utilities
that may have come with your card) and set the IRQ or address fields
accordingly.

Also:  Some systems with the OPTI chipset will require you to #define
BROKEN_BUS_CLOCK in /sys/i386/sound/pas2_card.c.  Symptoms are that
you will hear a lot of clicking and popping sounds, like a geiger counter,
coming out of the PAS even when is not playing anything.

Probing problems:  Since the SB16 uses the same IRQ and addresses for
the different drivers, some of the snd dirvers will not be probed because
the kernel thinks there is a conflict.  Until a real solution is implemented,
to get all the snd drivers to work, immediately return(0) to the haveseen()
call in /sys/i386/isa/isa.c on your local copy.  (Warning: doing this
will bypass checks for ALL drivers, so be careful)
