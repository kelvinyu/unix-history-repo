Hello, Emacs, this is an -*- Indented-Text -*- file!

$Id: Changes,v 1.10 1994/02/03 02:50:37 davidg Exp $

This file is intended to keep track of important kernel and user
changes in FreeBSD between releases.  Entries are in reverse
chronological order; userids can be decoded with the chart at the end
of this file.

Since 1.0.2:
- Substantial changes to system configuration; you MUST re-build
  `config' before attempting to build a 1.1 kernel.  (nate/martin)

- Improved the quality of the information given to the user when
  a fatal trap occurs.  (davidg)

- Added support in the if_ed driver for the WD8013W, WD8003W, and
  WD8003EB.  (davidg)

- Change to generic console code to eliminate console hangs with all 
  "pc" consoles.  (davidg)

- Upgrade to new version of sycons which handles the `hanging console'
  problem and adds some new features and code cleanup.  (nate)

- Various TCP bugs fixed - don't forward loopback packets; Nagel
  congestion avoidence - immediately ack small packets.  (davidg)

- TCP debugging code is now truly optional, thus reducing kernel size
  when it is disabled (the default).  (davidg)

- Performance and stylistic improvements to the `sio' serial driver.
  Probe code now works somewhat better for oddball devices.  The 16550
  FIFO length is now configurable using `flags' in the config
  declaration.  (ache/bde)

- Performance improvements and complete implementation of POSIX VMIN
  and VTIME for the generic TTY code.  (ache/bde)

- Crash dumps on SCSI disks now work and are standard.  (rgrimes/davidg)

- QMAGIC is now the official default executable format.  (davidg)

- Network booting is now supported, as is booting from DOS.  (martin)

- Local LDTs are now supported for WINE (based on work by John Brezak).
  (hsu/davidg)

- DDB will now print symbolic arguments and line numbers in
  backtraces (from John Brezak).  (davidg)

- Added four pattern memory test to eliminate problems with buggy
  chipsets that incorrectly map memory, and to find problems with
  defective memory. The memory sizing code has been improved to
  further eliminate problems with buggy chipsets/BIOSs.  (davidg)

- USE_486_WRITE_PROTECT is now gone; the system will automatically
  detect 486 CPUs and behave accordingly.  (davidg)

- Added SysV IPC, messaging, and semaphore code by Danny Boulet.
  (hsu/davidg)

- Substantial VM system improvements: (dyson/davidg)
	o FreeBSD once again works on 4-MB machines.
	o Maximum and default size limits set to reasonable values.
	o The user area is now in the process address space, and can
	  now be paged out along with the rest of the process.
	o Process page tables can now be paged out.
	o The physical map (pmap) module has been mostly rewritten for
	  efficiency, and is considerably faster than it used to be.
	o The pageout system now actually implements modified LRU.
	o Process RSS soft limits implemented. Hooks are in place for
	  RSS hard limits.
	o Pagers can now do multiple-page operations ("page fault
	  clustering"), and page fault read behind and read ahead
	  have been implemented to take advantage of this.
	o The vnode pager no longer drags pages through the buffer
	  cache, eliminating an expensive memory copy and flushing
	  of cached data.
	o When the system runs out of swap space, the faulting process
	  is killed off (with a message to syslog); the old code would
	  just deadlock.
	o Swap space allocation is much more efficient, and swap
	  striping actually works now. It's now possible for every
	  last block of swap space to be used before the systems runs
	  out.
	o The pagedaemon's algorithms are considerably improved, thus
	  reducing the amount of CPU time used by the pagedaemon.
	o All kernels MUST now load at virtual address 0xf010000, and
	  the lower 640k is reclaimed for system use. This removes
	  the 640K kernel size limit.
	o VM object cache size is now dynamic and a function of the
	  kernel 'maxusers' parameter.
	o Memory in the I/O hole is explicitly marked non-cacheable.

- Added 3C509 driver written by Herb Peyerl. (nate)

- Added a new 'wd' driver which does a much better job of probing, handles
  stray interrupts better, and supports multiple controllers.  In addition
  this driver supports DOS partitions much better and conforms to ATA specs
  much better.  NB: configuration lines for this driver are different
  than those for pervious versions; see a GENERIC for details.
  (nate/bde/guido)

- Added support in the if_ed driver for the Toshiba ethernet cards.The
  support must be enabled with an "options TOSH_ETHER" in the config
  file. Done it this way, because i don't know how widespread this cards
  are. (ats)

- Added support in the if_ed driver for the SMC Ultra via patches from
  Glen Lowe. (davidg)

- Add extended formats set to floppy driver, improve autoconfiguration,
  add "fdformat" utility for floppy formatting.
  (ache/joerg/Serge Vakulenko)

- Add XNTPD to contrib section, and (un-compilable) kernel support for
  same to /sys/kern.  (wollman)

- Use linker-constructed sets to initialize certain system tables
  rather than manually enumerating all the options in the source files.
  This makes certain pseudo-devices and all image activators drop-in at
  link time, if desired.  (wollman)

- Added YP code from Theo Deraadt.  (paul)

- Make all mandatory options ``standard''.  (wollman)

- Re-design execve() system call to allow for multiple ``image activators''
  which recognize and load various file formats.  Currently only
  a.out and interpreted formats are recognized.  (davidg)

- Separate all IP-related variables that users might want to modify into
  netinet/in_var.c.  (wollman)
