This file is intended to keep track of important kernel and user
changes in FreeBSD between releases.

Since 1.0.2:

- Added a new 'wd' driver which does a much better job of probing, handles
  stray interrupts better, and supports multiple controllers

- Fixed various swap 'leaks' and significantly improved paging
  performance.  (davidg/dyson)

- Add XNTPD to contrib section, and (un-compilable) kernel support for
  same to /sys/kern.  (wollman)

- Use linker-constructed sets to initialize certain system tables
  rather than manually enumerating all the options in the source files.
  This makes certain pseudo-devices and all image activators drop-in at
  link time, if desired.  (wollman)

- Make all mandatory options ``standard''.  (wollman)

- Re-design execve() system call to allow for multiple ``image activators''
  which recognize and load various file formats.  Currently only
  a.out and interpreted formats are recognized.  (davidg)

- Separate all IP-related variables that users might want to modify into
  netinet/in_var.c.  (wollman)

- Update to latest ADO timezone code, and update some timezone files beyond
  that.  (wollman, ache, Adam David)

- Added support in the if_ed driver for the Toshiba ethernet cards.The
  support must be enabled with an "options TOSH_ETHER" in the config
  file. Done it this way, because i don't know how widespread this cards
  are. (ats)

- Add extended formats set to floppy driver, improve autoconfiguration,
  add "fdformat" utility for floppy formatting.
