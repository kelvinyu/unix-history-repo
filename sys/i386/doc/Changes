Hello, Emacs, this is an -*- Indented-Text -*- file!

$Id: Changes,v 1.7 1994/02/01 06:55:07 nate Exp $

This file is intended to keep track of important kernel and user
changes in FreeBSD between releases.  Entries are in reverse
chronological order; userids can be decoded with the chart at the end
of this file.

Since 1.0.2:
- Substantial changes to system configuration; you MUST re-build
  `config' before attempting to build a 1.1 kernel.  (nate/martin)

- Upgrade to new version of sycons which handles the 'hanging console'
  problem and adds some new features and code cleanup. (nate)

- Various TCP bugs fixed.  (davidg)

- TCP debugging code is now truly optional, thus reducing kernel size
  when it is disabled (the default).  (davidg)

- Performance and stylistic improvements to the `sio' serial driver.
  (ache/bde)

- Performance improvements and partial implementation of POSIX VMIN
  and VTIME for the generic TTY code.  (ache/bde)

- Crash dumps on SCSI disks now work and are standard.  (rgrimes)

- QMAGIC is now the official default executable format.  (davidg)

- Network booting is now supported, as is booting from DOS.  (martin)

- Local LDTs are now supported for WINE (port by Jeffrey Hsu).
  (davidg)

- DDB will now print symbolic arguments and line numbers in
  backtraces (from John Brezak).  (davidg)

- Substantial VM system improvements: (davidg/dyson)
	o FreeBSD once again works on 4-MB machines.
	o Maximum and default size limits set to reasonable values.
	o The user area is now in the process address space, and can
	  now be paged out along with the rest of the process.
	o Page tables are no longer wired doan and can also be paged
	  out.
	o The physical map (pmap) module has been mostly rewritten for
	  efficiency, and is considerably faster than it used to be.
	o The pageout system now actually implements LRU.
	o Hooks are in place for process RSS limits.
	o Pagers can now do multiple-page operations.
	o Pre-paging has been implemented to take advantage of this.
	o The vnode pager no longer drags pages through the buffer
	  cache, eliminating an expensive memory copy.
	o When the system runs out of swap space, the faulting process
	  is killed off (with a message to syslog); the old code would
	  just deadlock.
	o Swap space allocation is much more efficient, and swap
	  striping actually works now.
	o The pagedaemon's algorithms are considerably improved, thus
	  reducing the amount of CPU time used by the pagedaemon.
	o All kernels MUST now load at virtual address 0xf010000, and
	  the lower 640k is reclaimed for system use.
	o The system now automatically sizes memory at start-up, thus
	  eliminating problems with buggy chipsets that don't map all
	  the user's memory in the right places.
	o VM object cache size increased significantly.
	o Memory in the I/O hole is explicitly marked non-cacheable
	  for the 486.
	o USE_486_WRITE_PROTECT is now gone; the system will
	  automatically detect 486 CPUs and behave accordingly.

- Added 3C509 driver written by Herb Peyerl. (anybody claim this?)

- Added a new 'wd' driver which does a much better job of probing, handles
  stray interrupts better, and supports multiple controllers.  In addition
  this driver supports DOS partitions much better and conforms to ATA specs
  much better.  NB: configuration lines for this driver are different
  than those for pervious versions; see a GENERIC for details.  (nate/bde)

- Added support in the if_ed driver for the Toshiba ethernet cards.The
  support must be enabled with an "options TOSH_ETHER" in the config
  file. Done it this way, because i don't know how widespread this cards
  are. (ats)

- Add extended formats set to floppy driver, improve autoconfiguration,
  add "fdformat" utility for floppy formatting.
  (ache/joerg/Serge Vakulenko)

- Add XNTPD to contrib section, and (un-compilable) kernel support for
  same to /sys/kern.  (wollman)

- Use linker-constructed sets to initialize certain system tables
  rather than manually enumerating all the options in the source files.
  This makes certain pseudo-devices and all image activators drop-in at
  link time, if desired.  (wollman)

- Make all mandatory options ``standard''.  (wollman)

- Re-design execve() system call to allow for multiple ``image activators''
  which recognize and load various file formats.  Currently only
  a.out and interpreted formats are recognized.  (davidg)

- Separate all IP-related variables that users might want to modify into
  netinet/in_var.c.  (wollman)

- Update to latest ADO timezone code, and update some timezone files beyond
  that.  (wollman, ache, Adam David)
