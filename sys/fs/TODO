My claim to copyright is for this file, and the derived work of the conversion
and intergration from the UCLA FICUS project and BSD 4.4.

1)  IMPORT the following code after I get a ruling from Bostic on it:
	deadfs		ffs		fifofs*
	lfs		lofs		mfs
	nullfs		specfs		ufs
	umapfs

    * missing this one!


2)  Extract/write common file system code and put it in sys/fs/common.


3)  Port the following current file system code to the new vfs layer
	cdfs*		dosfs		nfs
	procfs

    * cdfs is a new rewrite of isofs that is work in process.
