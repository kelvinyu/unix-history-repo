My claim to copyright is for this file, and the derived work of the conversion
and intergration from the UCLA FICUS project and BSD 4.4.

This area (/sys/fs) is currently under contruction.  What is here has not
yet been intergrated into the rest of the kernel.  It has been placed into
the cvs tree of FreeBSD so that the work that is occuring in this area is
visible to the FreeBSD team.

This file will be growing as work goes on in the intergration of the rest of
the code.  For now only the lfs code has been imported and minimally cleaned
up.


HISTORY of work on doing the new fs system:
Sun Jan 23 1994
	sys/fs:
		Initial creation of the new fs code tree.
	sys/fs/lfs:
		Imported lfs as it was supplied.  Fixed sccsid's to be a
		reference to the original BSD 4.4 code.  Added $Id: README,v 1.1 1994/01/24 05:40:29 rgrimes Exp $ to all lfs 
		files.  Fixed #includes for the new structure of the source
		tree.
Fri Jan 28 1994
	sys/fs/lfs:
		Removed all code per Keith Bostic.
