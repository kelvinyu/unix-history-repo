TARGET_BIG_ENDIAN must die

Changes in MACHINE_ARCH:

mips (big endian)	mipseb
mips (little endian)	mipsel
arm (little endian)	arm		For historical reasons
arm (big endian)	armeb

What we call today MACHINE_ARCH is really MACHINE_CPUARCH.  This is
called MACHINE_CPU on NetBSD, but FreeBSD already uses MACHINE_CPU for
other purposes.  In general $MACHINE_ARCH -> $MACHINE_CPUARCH in most
places in the tree.  MACHINE_CPUARCH is defined in bsd.own.mk, since
it is dependent on the bsd tree, actually.  All the translation from
MACHINE_ARCH to MACHINE_CPUARCH assumes that all members of that
family are supported by one set of files on FreeBSD.  So mips files
have support for both big and little endian.  But MACHINE_ARCH
determines the default binaries that are generated.

We'll likely need to have a MACHINE_ABI at some point.  Both MIPS and
ARM have multiple ABIs, and we'll need something to be the default,
and different CPUs within a family might have different defaults.
Etc.  Plus there's t he need for multilib.  However, issues like this
are beyond the scope of this branch.
