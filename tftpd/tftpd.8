.SH NAME
tftpd \- DARPA Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/tftpd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tftpd
is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File Transfer
Protocol.
The TFTP server operates
at the port indicated in the ``tftp'' service description;
see
.IR services (5).
The server is normally started by
.IR inetd (8).
.PP
The use of
.I tftp
does not require an account or password on the remote system.
Due to the lack of authentication information, 
.I tftpd
will allow only publicly readable files to be
accessed.
Files may be written only if they already exist and are publicly writable.
Note that this extends the concept of ``public'' to include
all users on all hosts that can be reached through the network;
this may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications
should be considered before enabling tftp service.
The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.
