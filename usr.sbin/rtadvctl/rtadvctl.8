.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar subcommand

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that communicates
.Xr rtadvd 8
daemon and displays information on Router Advertisement messages being
sent on each interfaces.
.Pp
This utility provides several options and subcommands.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl v

.Nm
utility shows additional information on prefixes, RDNSS, and DNSSL
options.

some statistics.
.El
.Pp
The subcommands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It reload

.Xr rtadvd 8
daemon shut down immediately.
.It show Op interfaces...
Displays information on Router Advertisement messages being sent
on each interfaces.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rtadv 8 ,
.Xr rtadvd.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr rtadvd 8
daemon stops responding to
.Nm
for a while just after reloading the configuration file by the reload
subcommand.
This is because in the current implementation it cannot communicate
with
.Nm
during sending some additional RAs for graceful transition from one
configuration to another.
It will take at most nine seconds for each interface.
