.sh NAME
typeof \- get the typeof of a terminal from the \fIttytype\fR data base
.sh SYNOPSIS
typeof(tty)
.br
\fBchar\fR tty;
.s3
\fBchar\fR *
.br
stypeof(tty)
.br
\fBchar\fR tty;
.sh DESCRIPTION
These routines extract the terminal type from the
.it ttytype
data base given a single character terminal character such as returned
from
.it ttyn
(III).
The only difference between the two routines is that
.it typeof
returns two characters packed into an integer,
while
.it stypeof
returns a pointer to a string;
the string is in a static place so it must be saved if 
.it stypeof 
is to be called again.
