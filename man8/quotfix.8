.sh NAME
quotfix \- correct block quota files on a subtree
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd quotfix
[
.bd \-
] [
.bd \-a
] [
.bd \-n
] [
dirname ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Quotfix
recursively descends the directory structure 
starting at each named directory
and corrects any block quota files which deviate from 
the correct quota.
The current directory is the default if no directories are specified.
Use of quotfix requires super-user privileges.
.s3
By default,
.it quotfix
lists subdirectories which had incorrect quotas
and those which have exceeded their quota.
Directories with incorrect quotas are
represented on a line with an `e' in the first column, those with
the quota exceeded have a `>' in column 2.
.s3
The \fB\-\fR option suppresses all output.
.s3
The \fB\-n\fR option causes no corrections to be made.  The function is that
of a `check'.
.s3
The \fB\-a\fR option causes 
.it quotfix 
to break the summary down
with a listing for each quota file encountered.
The result is an indented
representation of the file system usage for the subtree
rooted at the specified directory.
.sh SEE\ ALSO
quot (I), du (I)
.sh BUGS
If there is any activity in the subtree while the
program is running, the result is likely to be incorrect.
.s3
.it Quotfix's
algorithm for setting quota's charges for each directory entry regardless
of the presence of multiple links.
The quota it determines agrees with the
result of
.it du
(I)
only in the absence of links.
In certain cases this makes
.it quotfix
almost useless;
.it quotfix
should be changed to work like
.it du.
