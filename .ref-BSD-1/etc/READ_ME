This directory contains prototype data files for /etc.
Htmp is here simply to indicate that it must exist... it can be created via
	cp /dev/null /etc/htmp
	chown bin /etc/htmp
	chmod 644 /etc/htmp

The file ttytype should be modified to conform to your configuration,
and new entries should be added to ttycap for the terminals which you
have.  Note that the programs "sethome", "tset" and "ttytype" must be able to
write on htmp so they must either be setuid or /etc/htmp must be mode 666
(safe only if you have a completely friendly community of users.)
