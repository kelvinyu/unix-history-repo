.sh NAME
htmp \- home directory and teletype data base
.sh DESCRIPTION
The home directory and teletype data base
.it htmp
is maintained by
.it login
(I)
and
.it su
(VIII)
and may also be modified by
.it ttytype
(VI)
and
.it sethome
(VI).
The file consists of an array of structures of the form:
.s3
.dt
	\fBstruct\fR htmp {
.br
		\fBint\fR	uid;
.br
		\fBchar\fR	home[28];
.br
		\fBint\fR	ttytype;
.br
	};
.s3
The
.it ttytype
is actually a two character code.
See
.it ttytype
(VI)
for a list.
.s3
The file is indexed by the various teletypes in a version-dependent
fashion.
For version 6 systems, the file is indexed by the result of a call
to
.it ttyn
(III).
