.th CD I 10/15/76
.sh NAME
cd \*- change working directory
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd cd
directory
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Directory
becomes the new working directory.
The process must have execute (search)
permission in
.it directory.
.s3
Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.it cd
would be ineffective if it were written as a
normal command.  It is therefore recognized and executed
by the Shell.
.it Cd
is exactly equivalent to
.it chdir
(I).
.sh "SEE ALSO"
sh (I), pwd (I), chdir (I)
