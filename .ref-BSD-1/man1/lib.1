.th LIB I 10/14/76
.sh NAME
lib \*- specify user libraries
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd lib
directory ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Lib
is used to specify user libraries to be searched by the shell.
The libraries are searched after the current directory and before
the system libraries `/bin' and `/usr/bin'.
.it Lib
with no arguments prints the current library.  To specify no
libraries do:
.s2
.ti 10
lib ""
.br
.s3
.it Lib
is executed within the Shell.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
sh (I), glob2 (VIII)
.sh BUGS
Other than the shell and
.it glob2
(VIII)
which receives the library names explicitly,
there is no access to the current library names for user or other system
commands.
Thus
.it time
(I),
.it nice
(I),
.it nohup
(I),
.it if
(I),
.it find
(I),
and
.it repeat
(VI)
among others don't act as one would first expect.
