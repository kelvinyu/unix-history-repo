This directory contains the source for a floating point interpreter
modified to work in separate i/d space with a system call "fetchi"
as described in ../SETUP.  The interpreter assumes that the
system call in number 61.

If you have to add this call because you don't have floating point hardware,
and you cannot make it call 61. you don't have to remake all the Pascal
stuff... simply running the "load" scripts in ../pi, ../pxp and ../px
is sufficient... these don't require that you have a version 7 C compiler.
