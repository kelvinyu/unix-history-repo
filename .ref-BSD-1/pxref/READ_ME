To make a pxref do
	makepxref
It can be installed using
	install
If you have a shell which recognizes Pascal objects it is not necessary
to use both the Pascal and C programs... the Pascal object can be put in
/usr/bin... but it will have the same status as shell scripts (essentially)
thus
	time pxref pxref.p
would not work then.
