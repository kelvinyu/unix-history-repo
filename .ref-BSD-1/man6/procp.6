.sh NAME
procp \- print information about a process
.sh SYNOPSIS
procp [ pid ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Procp
is a program which prints out the system information about
a process.
The argument process id is used, or if none is given,
.it procp
prints out information about itself.
Thus a
.it procp
of a pascal translation with
.it pi
running in the background
might give the following output:
.s3
.nf
.dt
.dt

Here the first line gives the process number, the second and third
lines information from the process table entry,
the fourth and fifth lines information from the
.it "u dot."
These are followed by information about each file which the process
has open,
and finally a listing of signals which have other than their default
actions.
