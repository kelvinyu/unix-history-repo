.sh NAME
pss \- show active processes
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd pss
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Pss
is a shell script which does a
.it "ps axl"
and processes the output, removing login shells and instances of
.it getty.
The result is then sorted by teletype.
.it Pss
is useful for seeing what is going on in the system.
.sh SEE\ ALSO
procp (VI), ps (I)
.sh BUGS
.it Pss
is a shell script which uses
.it grep
and
.it sort.
Because of the
.it sort
.it pss
must finish all processing before any output occurs.
On a heavily loaded system, this may take a large amount of time.
.it Pss
would be much faster if it were an option of 
.it ps.
