.th TTYTYPE VI 11/15/77
.sh NAME
ttytype \- indicate (or inquire about) terminal type in system data base
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ttytype
[
.bd \-n
] [
[
.bd \-d
]
type
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
The system maintains a data base giving the type of each terminal and the
home directory of the user logged in on that terminal.
This information is initialized at login \-
the terminal type from the
.it ttytype
data base,
and the home directory from the user's entry in the password file.
.it Ttytype
can be used to interrogate and change the teletype type portion
of this information.
The most common use for
.it ttytype
is when using a dial-up port.
.it Ttytype
is necessary in this case because the system cannot know the type of
terminal being used.
.s3
The options of
.it ttytype
are:
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-d\fR	Perform the action implied by the rest of the command
only if the terminal in use is a dial-up port.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-n\fR	Print the type codes for terminals on this system.
.s3
.i0
If
.it ttytype
is given no arguments,
it prints the type recorded in the data base for this terminal.
If given a
.it type
the type recorded in the data base will be changed to that type.
Thus to tell the system that you dialed up on an
\s-2LSI ADM-3A\s0
you could use the command
.s3
.dt
.bd "	ttytype adm3a"
.s3
If you frequently dial-up on a
\s-2DECWRITER\-II\s0
you could put the command
.s3
.dt
.bd "	ttytype \-d decwriter"
.s3
in your
.bd \&.start_up
file.
.s3
