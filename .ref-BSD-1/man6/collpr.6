.sh NAME
collpr \- simulate model 37 tty on the line printer
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd collpr
[
.bd \-
] [
file ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Collpr
simulates a model 37 teletype for doing
.it nroff
output on the line printer.
Pages are buffered and reverse line-feed and half-line feed sequences
are interpreted.
.s3
Half-line up material is overstruck on the previous line, half-line
down material is struck on the current line.
In general, though, overstruck characters are lost, except for
underlining.
Combinations of `\-' or `_' and `|' are turned into `+', i.e. at the
corner of boxes.
.s3
The optional argument
.bd \-
causes the output to be sent to the standard
output.
By default it is sent to an instance of the line printer daemon,
.it lpr
(I).
.s3
A typical usage of
.it collpr
would be
.s3
.dt
	tbl exum2.n | nroff \-ms | collpr
.s3
to
.it nroff
the document in the file
.it exum2.n
and send it to the line printer with a approximation of the tables
printing there.

.sh BUGS
Output can't be backed up more than 102 lines.
.s3
Overstriking is lost.
.s3
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
.s3
Superscripts of the first output line are lost.
.s3
If more than one file is specified, the program does not pad
the files out with a form feed as
.it lpr
would do.
.s3
Should move subscripts down a line rather than printing them
on the same line as the normal material.
