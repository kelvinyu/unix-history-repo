.sh NAME
last \- indicate last logins of users and teletypes
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd last
[
.bd \-
] [
name ...
] [
tty ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Last
will look back in the
.it wtmp
file which records all logins and logouts for information about
a user, a teletype or any group of users and/or teletypes.
A single character argument specifies a teletype of interest,
multi-character arguments specify users of interest.
.it Last
will print the sessions of the specified users and teletypes,
most recent first, indicating the times at which the session
began, the duration of the session, and the teletype which the
session took place on.
If the session is still continuing or was cut short by a crash,
.it last
so indicates.
.s3
The teletype
.bd ~
records the crashes of the system; thus
.dt
.s3
	last ~
.s3
will give an indication of the reliability of the system.
.s3
.it Last
with no arguments prints a record of all logins and logouts, in
reverse order.
The special argument
.bd \-
suppresses all sessions by users who have the character `\-'
in their login names or whose login names begin with a digit.
This can be used to suppress student accounts, which have
this format on the Cory Hall system at UC Berkeley.
.s3
If
.it last
is interrupted, it indicates how far the search has progressed
in
.it wtmp.
