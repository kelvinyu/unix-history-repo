.th PX VI 9/10/77
.sh NAME
px \- Pascal interpreter
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd px
[ obj [ argument ... ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Px
interprets the abstract machine code generated by
.it pi.
The first argument is the file to be interpreted, and defaults
to
\fIobj\fR\|;
remaining arguments are available to the Pascal program using the
built-ins
.it argv
and
.it argc.
.it Px
is also invoked by
.it pix
when running ``load and go''.
.s3
If the program terminates abnormally an error message and a 
control flow backtrace are printed.
The number of statements executed and total execution time
are printed after normal termination.
The
.bd p
option of
.it pi
suppresses all of this except the message indicating the cause
of abnormal termination.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Most run-time error messages are self-explanatory.
Some of the more unusual ones are:
.s3
.lp +6 3
Reference to an inactive file
.br
A file other than
.it input
or
.it output
was used before a call to
.it reset
or
.it rewrite.
.s3
.lp +6 3
Statement count limit exceeded
.br
The limit of 500,000 executed statements
(which prevents excessive looping or recursion)
has been exceeded.
.s3
.lp +6 3
Bad data found on integer read
.lp +6 3
Bad data found on real read
.br
Usually, non-numeric input was found for a number.
For reals, Pascal requires digits before and after the decimal
point so that numbers like `.1' or `21.' evoke the second diagnostic.
.s3
.lp +6 3
panic: \fISome message\fP
.br
Indicates a internal inconsistency detected in
.it px
probably due to a Pascal system bug.

.sh BUGS
Calls to the procedures
.it dispose
and
.it linelimit
are ignored.
.s3
Post-mortem traceback is not limited;
infinite recursion leads to almost infinite traceback.
.s3
Because interrupts sometimes find the system in the middle of a
.bd procedure
or
.bd function
entry or exit,
the error backtrace on an interrupt is occasionally meaningless.
The current line is, however, always correct;
only the call backtrace and the name of the current routine may be lost.
