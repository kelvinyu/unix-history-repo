.sh NAME
pxp \- Pascal execution profiler
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd pxp
[

.bd \-23456789
] [
.bd \-z
[ name ... ] ] name.p
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Pxp
can be used to obtain execution profiles of Pascal programs or
as a pretty-printer.
To produce an execution profile all that is necessary is to translate
the program specifying the
.bd z
option to
.it pi
or
.it pix,
to execute the program,
and to then issue the command
.dt
.s3
	\fBpxp \-z\fR name.p
.s3
A reformatted listing is output if none of the
\fBc\fR,
\fBt\fR,
or
\fBz\fR
options are specified;
thus
.s3
	\fBpxp\fR old.p > new.p
.s3
places a pretty-printed version of the program in `old.p' in the file `new.p'.
.s3
The use of the following options of
.it pxp
is discussed in sections 2.6, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.10 of the
\fIUNIX Pascal User's Manual\fR.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-a\fR	Print the bodies of all procedures and functions in the profile;
even those which were never executed.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-c\fR	Extract profile data from the file
\fIcore\fR.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-d\fR	Include declaration parts in a profile.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-e\fR	Eliminate
.bd include
directives when reformatting a file;
the
.bd include
is replaced by the reformatted contents of the specified
file.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-f\fR	Fully parenthesize expressions.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-j\fR	Left justify all procedures and functions.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-n\fR	Eject a new page 
as each file is included;
in profiles, print a blank line at the top of the page.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-s\fR	Strip comments from the input text.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-t\fR	Print a table summarizing
\fBprocedure\fR
and
\fBfunction\fR
call counts.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-u\fR	Card image mode; only the first 72 characters of input lines
are used.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-w\fR	Suppress warning diagnostics.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-z\fR	Generate an execution profile.
If no
\fIname\fR\|s,
are given the profile is of the entire program.
If a list of names is given, then only any specified
\fBprocedure\fRs
or
\fBfunction\fRs
and the contents of any specified
.bd include
files will appear in the profile.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-\_\fR	Underline keywords.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\-\fId\fR	With
\fId\fR
a digit, 2 \(<= \fId\fR \(<= 9,
causes
.it pxp
to use \fId\fP spaces as the basic indenting unit.
The default is 4.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
For a basic explanation do
.s3
.dt
.bd	pxp
.s3
Error diagnostics include
``No profile data in file''
with the
.bd c
option if the
.bd z
option was not enabled to
.it pi;
``Not a Pascal system core file''
if the core is not from a
.it px
execution;
``Program and count data do not correspond''
if the program was changed after compilation, before profiling;
or if the wrong program is specified.
