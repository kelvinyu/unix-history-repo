writing the result to the standard output.
.s3
There can be at most 50 parameters each of which consists of a
`+' or `\-'
followed by a number (the `+' is optional).
The numbers define the starting line number where
lines are to be copied to the output file or thrown away.
`+n' or `n' means begin to copy data;
`\-n' means begin to throw away data.
.s3
To get the first 10 lines of a file one can do
.dt
.s3
	linerm \-11 < file
.s3
To extract the middle 20 lines of 
.it file
you can use the command
.s3
	linerm \-1 30 \-50 <file 
.s3
Unless otherwise specified \fIlinerm\fP will start out in
the copy state.
Thus
.s3
	linerm 1 \-10
.s3
is exactly the same as
.s3
	linerm \-10
