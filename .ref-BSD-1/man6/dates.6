.it Dates
normally dispalys only events which will or have happened today,
or will happen in the future.
By specifying two arguments, you can ask

to start at a different date.
Thus
.s3

.s3
asks for events happening after 11:30 am on December 4, while
.s3
	dates 1/1/78
.s3
asks for events starting with the first one in 1978.
The year and time are optional.
.s3
The class master accounts and the super-user may add events to the
calendar and delete events.
To add an event one specifies three arguments, the second and
third arguments being an identifying tag for this entry and a description, i.e.:
.s3
	dates 12/31/77 "New years eve" "A holiday"
.s3
or more seriously
.s3
	dates 9/27 "CS40 Assignment 1" "Fibbonnaci numbers"
.s3
The identifying tag and description are limited to 30 characters.
.s3
To delete an entry just give the first three arguments, thus
.s3
	dates 9/27 "CS40 Assignment 1"
.s3
Would delete the last entry above.
