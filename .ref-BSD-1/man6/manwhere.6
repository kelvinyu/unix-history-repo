.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Manwhere
will look for each of the specified commands in the on-line manual.
If it exists in any section of the manual, the number of that section
will be printed.
If it is not in any section of the manual,
.it manwhere
will so indicate.
The optional
.bd \-
causes only undocumented commands to be listed.
It can be used, e.g.:
.s3
.dt
	chdir /bin
.br
	manwhere \- *
.s3
to see that a set of commands are all documented.
.s3
If a command is documented in an as yet uninstalled
section of the manual, it will be preceded by a string indicating
the location of this documentation.
For Cory
UNIX, the character `P' indicates that documentation
is in preparation for the section in question.
