squash \- reduce object file size
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd squash
file ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Squash
invokes the loader to reduce the size of the argument files.
It is equivalent to the shell script:
.s3
.dt
.nf
	: loop
	if $1x = x exit
	ld \-S \-X \-r \-o x.out $1
	mv x.out $1
	goto loop
.fi
.s3
but is faster and checks for errors.
The resulting objects will load faster.
.it Squash
is especially appropriate for routines which are to be in a library.
