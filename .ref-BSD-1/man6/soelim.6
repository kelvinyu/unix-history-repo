.th SOELIM VI 8/24/77
.sh NAME
soelim \- eliminate source directives from a \fInroff\fR or \fItroff\fR stream
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd soelim
[
file ...
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Soelim
reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the textual
inclusion implied by the
.it nroff
directives of the form
.s3
.dt
	.so somefile
.s3
when they appear at the beginning of input lines.
This is useful since programs such as
.it tbl
do not normally do this;
it allows the placement of individual tables
in separate files to be run as a part of a large document.
.s3
Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using
`\'' instead of `\.', i.e.
.s3
.dt
	\'so /usr/lib/tmac.s
.s3
A sample usage of
.it soelim
would be
.s3
	soelim exum?.n | tbl | nroff -ms | collpr
.sh SEE\ ALSO
colcrt (VI), collpr (VI), cr3 (VI)
