Here are a passwd command which asks you for the password twice so
you dont screw yourself up, and a shell which has a couple nice features
(interruptible waits, redirect unit 2) and which knows about Pascal
objects... the glob (../s8/glob2.c) which goes with this shell
takes arbitrary path names, i.e.
	/*/mbox

This shell has been the standard at Berkeley for over a year.

The login and su in ../s8 maintain the htmp data base, and also
implement ".start_up" files which a shell runs when you log in.
Also implemented are the file ".reminder" which you can place
in your login directory to have catted on your terminal when you
log in.

These features of login are superfluous if you have "../ashell"
but very useful otherwise.  The "su" program also maintains an
unused byte in /etc/utmp so that the "who" here can print out
who you are "su'd" to ... currently we disable su's to anyone but
the root except by the root ... this is easy to take out.
