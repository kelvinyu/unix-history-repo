These are the routines for manipulating the editor data bases.
They live in ../s7/libX.a
The program "Ttyn.c" is actually made by the program "makeTtyn"
in ../s6... it produces a hashed version of "ttyn" called "Ttyn"
which is useful because it runs much faster... it is however
dependent on the structure of your /dev/.
If you want the editor and ashell to start faster you can have them
call a version of Ttyn which you can make using the program 
makeTtyn for your system.
