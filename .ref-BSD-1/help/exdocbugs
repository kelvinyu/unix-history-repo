_T_a_b_l_e _o_f _C_o_n_t_e_n_t_s

     On page ii under _S_u_m_m_a_r_y _T_a_b_l_e_s change _O_p_e_n _a_n_d _v_i_s_u_a_l _t_a_r_g_e_t_s to _O_p_e_n
_a_n_d _v_i_s_u_a_l _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s.

_C_r_a_s_h _R_e_c_o_v_e_r_y

     It is no longer true that you must have had a  current  file  name  to
recover after a crash; files with no name are arbitrarily named ``LOST''.

     Also note that if the system crashes you will  receive  mail  when  it
comes  up  telling you of the name of the file saved for you if you were in
the editor.

_F_i_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The _f_i_l_e command description should begin ``The current filename'' not
``The  current  file''  as  the editor does not have a current file, only a
current filename associated with a buffer.

_V_i_s_u_a_l _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The _v_i_s_u_a_l command may take a trailing count indicating the number  of
lines  to  be used (physical) in the window.  The default for this count is
the value of the _w_i_n_d_o_w option.

_V_i_s_u_a_l _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s

     The operations ``e'', ``E'', ``<'' and ``>''  are  implemented  unless
you are on a machine without separate I/D space (Evans "D" system) in which
case the features ``0CTRL(d)'' and ``^CTRL(d)'' with _a_u_t_o_i_n_d_e_n_t in _o_p_e_n and
_v_i_s_u_a_l also don't work.

_E_x _m_a_n_u_a_l _s_e_c_t_i_o_n

     Add the following bugs:

     Lines which are _c_h_a_n_g_e_d or _j_o_i_n_e_d lose marks; it would be  better  for
     the marks to be attached to the (first) new line.

     There should be an option for maintaining a perfectly clean screen  in
     _v_i_s_u_a_l and open on very fast (or intelligent) terminals.

_T_t_y_c_a_p _d_a_t_a _b_a_s_e

     In the descripton of the ttycap data base, change ``set and  cleared''
to ``cleared and set'' in the second line of the third paragraph.  Refer to
stty (II) for more information about the flags described in this paragraph.
