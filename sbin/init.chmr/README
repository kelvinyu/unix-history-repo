This is a new version of /sbin/init, with many features:
already implemented and working:
	o modular design (separate function for each state)
	o error logging via syslog()
	o extensive debugging facilities (compile time option)
	o detection of failing getty processes (exit status and runtime)
	o if a getty process is failing repeatedly, retry it after
	  configurable time intervals.
	o recovery from non-fatal errors such as out of memory or
	  fork failed.
	o a manual page
	o most parameters can be changed from a configuration file (default
	  startup state, retry time etc)
	o some system parameters can also be set from the configuration file
	  (default process limits, initial environment variables)
	o fully compatible with old init (if config file does not exist)
planned but not yet implemented:
	o redirecting error messages to stderr instead of syslog if init
	  is executed by the user (Syntaxcheck)
	o support for ty_window (for window systems)
	o maybe sometime support for /etc/inittab

I'm interested in any feedback you have !
