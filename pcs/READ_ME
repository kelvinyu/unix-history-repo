This directory contains the source for the Pascal program pascals.
It should be put in /usr/lib/pascals, the C program in in ../s6/pascals.c
should be put in /usr/bin/pascals... this C driver hunts up "px"
and executes the /usr/lib/pascals.

For this program to run at any sort of reasonable speed it should be
compiled with the options "-p" and "-t" and preferably "-b", i.e.:

	pi -pbt pascals.p
