/*
 * A number of small tests to confirm that attaching ACCF_DATA accept filters
 * to inet4 ports works as expected.  We test:
 *
 * - That no accept filter is attached on a newly created socket.
 * - That bind() has no affect on the accept filter state.
 * - That we can't attach an accept filter to a socket that isn't in the
 *   listen state.
 * - That after we fail to attach the filter, querying the kernel shows no
 *   filter attached.
 * - That we can attach an accept filter to a socket that is in the listen
 *   state.
 * - That once an accept filter is attached, we can query to make sure it is
 *   attached.
 * - That once an accept filter is attached, we can remove it and query to
 *   make sure it is removed.
