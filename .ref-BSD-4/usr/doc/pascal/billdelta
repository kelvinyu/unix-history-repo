Subject: pascal users manual

i looked it over yesterday, and noticed the following:

1. on the first 2 pages the support/address things are given twice...
see the old copy, i snowpaked or fudged to get them on only one.

2. section 1.6 should say
	Ex Reference Manual \- Version 3.5
   dated
	October, 1980
   and
	An Introduction to the C shell (Revised)
   dated
	October, 1980
   and the programmers manual reference should say, after December, 1978:
	(Virtual VAX/11 Version,
	 U.C. Berkeley
	 Berkeley, Ca.
	 November, 1980.)

3. 2.1 if i say
	% ex first.p
   and first.p doesn't exist it says
	[New file]
   not No such file or directory
   It also says this when you write out the file.

4. in the example
	% pix first.p
   the output is missing

5. in the example after ``If we now use the UNIX ls list files command''
   the display is indented too much.

6. 2.4-- why is there extra white space between the line
	Execution terminated abnormally.
   and the line
	2 statements executed...
   This is a stupid incompatibility between the VAX and the 11.
   There is no reason to put in this extra linefeed.
   This is a manual for both vax and 11...

7. 3.3 in the section Out of Memory it says ``very large (10000) line
   programs.''  10000 lines isnt ``very large''; 25000 lines is very large.

8. 3.4 program errors.  once again a gratuiutous incompatibility with pdp-11.
   there are 2 extra line-feeds before ``subscript out of range''... see the
   output in the old version of the manual... i would prefer that these
   incompatibilities (which are only stylistic) be removed.

9. In the footnote in this section about 65k bytes for each variable...
   does this apply to pc also?

10. the times of the examples in 4.1 &c are very high (2* slower than
   those reported before... either overhead is not being accounted properly
   or the load on the machine was very hight skewing the times... try
   rerunning the examples when the machine is lightly loaded...)

11. 4.6 there are a bunch of extra blank lines in the examples at the
   end, incompatible in output format with pdp-11.

12. 5.8 this section should be deleted

13. 5.10 this section should be deleted

14. A.1 Enum type i/o -- how can an enumerated type value be out of
   range?

15. Separate compilation... pascal doesnt have ``modules''.

16. Option control -- sh
	% pi -ls foo.p 
    should say
	% pi -l -s foo.p

Thats all... ill read it again, more carefully if you point me at the
old and new sources so i can use diff to read faster.
