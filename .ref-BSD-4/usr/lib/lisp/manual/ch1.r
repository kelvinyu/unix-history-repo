                                FRANZ LISP







   _1._1.  FRANZ LISP[] was created as a tool to further research in Symbolic
      Algebraic  Manipulation,  Artificial  Intelligence,  and  programming
      languages at the University of California at Berkeley.  Its roots are
      in  the PDP-11 Lisp system which originally came from Harvard.  As it
      grew it adopted features of  Maclisp  and  Lisp  Machine  Lisp  which
      enables  our  work to be shared with colleagues at the Laboratory for
      Computer Science at M.I.T.  It is written almost entirely in the pro-
      gramming  language  C.   A  small  part  is  written in the assembler
      language for the current host machine, a  VAX  11/780,  and  part  is
      written  in Lisp.  Because FRANZ LISP is written in C, it is portable
      and easy to comprehend.

           FRANZ LISP is capable  of  running  large  lisp  programs  in  a
      timesharing  environment,  has facilities for arrays and user defined
      structures, has a user controlled  reader  with  character  and  word
      macro  capabilities, and can interact directly with compiled Lisp, C,
      Fortran, and Pascal code.




   _1._2.  This document is a reference manual for the FRANZ LISP system.  It
      is  not  a  Lisp  primer or introduction to the language.  Some parts
      will be of interest only to those maintaining  FRANZ  LISP  at  their
      computer site.  This document is divided into four Movements.  In the
      first one we will attempt to describe the language of FRANZ LISP pre-
      cisely  and completely as it now stands (Opus 33b, October 1980).  In
      the second Movement we will  look  at  the  reader,  function  types,
      arrays and exception handling.  In the third Movement we will look at
      several large support packages written to help the FRANZ  LISP  user,
      namely  the  trace package and compiler.  Finally the fourth movement
      contains  an index into the other movements.  In  the  rest  of  this
      chapter  we  shall examine the data types of FRANZ LISP.  The conven-
      tions used in the description of the FRANZ  LISP  functions  will  be
      given  in  section 1.4 -- it is very important that these conventions
      are  understood.

allegations have never been proven.



9FRANZ LISP                                                              1-1







FRANZ LISP                                                              1-2


   _1._3.  _D_a_t_a _T_y_p_e_s   FRANZ LISP has eleven data types.  In this section we
      shall look in detail at each type and if a type is divisible we shall
      look inside it.  There is a Lisp function _t_y_p_e which will return  the
      type name of a lisp object.  This is the official FRANZ LISP name for
      that type and we will use this name and this name only in the  manual
      to  avoid  confusing  the  reader.   The types are listed in terms of
      importance rather than alphabetically.




      _1._3._0.  _l_i_s_p_v_a_l   This is the  name  we  use  to  describe  any  lisp
         object.  The function _t_y_p_e will never return `lispval'.




      _1._3._1.  _s_y_m_b_o_l   This object corresponds to a variable in most  other
         programming  languages.   It may have a value or may be `unbound'.
         A symbol may be _l_a_m_b_d_a _b_o_u_n_d meaning that  its  current  value  is
         stored away somewhere and the symbol  is given a new value for the
         duration of a certain context.  When the  Lisp  processor   leaves
         that  context,  the  symbol's current value is thrown away and its
         old value is restored.
9         A symbol may also have a _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n _b_i_n_d_i_n_g.  This function  binding
         is static; it cannot be lambda bound.  Whenever the symbol is used
         in the functional position of a Lisp expression the function bind-
         ing  of the symbol is examined (see 4 for more details on  evalua-
         tion).
9         A symbol may also have a _p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _l_i_s_t, another static data struc-
         ture.   The  property list consists of a list of an even number of
         elements, considered to be grouped as pairs. The first element  of
         the pair is the _i_n_d_i_c_a_t_o_r the second the _v_a_l_u_e of that indicator.
9         Each symbol has a print name (_p_n_a_m_e) which is how this  symbol  is
         accessed from input and referred to on  (printed) output.  This is
         also used when one tests for equality of symbols using  the  func-
         tion _e_q_u_a_l.
9         A symbol also has a hashlink used to link symbols together in  the
         oblist -- this field is inaccessible to the lisp user.
9         Symbols are created by the reader and  by  the  functions  _c_o_n_c_a_t,
         _m_a_k_n_a_m  and  their derivatives.  Most symbols live on FRANZ LISP's
         sole _o_b_l_i_s_t, and therefore two symbols with the  same  print  name
         are  usually  the  exact same object (they are _e_q).  Symbols which
         are not on the oblist are said to  be  _u_n_i_n_t_e_r_n_e_d.   The  function
         _m_a_k_n_a_m  creates  uninterned  symbols while _c_o_n_c_a_t creates _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_d
         ones.

      _1._3._3.  _b_i_n_a_r_y   This type acts as  a  function  header  for  machine
         coded  functions.  It has two parts, a pointer to the start of the
         function and a symbol whose print name describes the argument _d_i_s_-
         _c_i_p_l_i_n_e.   The discipline (if _l_a_m_b_d_a, _m_a_c_r_o or _n_l_a_m_b_d_a) determines
         whether the arguments to this function will be  evaluated  by  the
         caller  before  this  function  is called.  If the discipline is a
         string (either "_s_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e",  "_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n",  "_i_n_t_e_g_e_r-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n",  or
         "_r_e_a_l-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n")  then  this  function  is a foreign subroutine or
         function (see 8.4 for more details on this).  Although the type of
         the  _e_n_t_r_y  field of a binary type object is either string or fix-
         num, the object pointed to  is  actually  a  sequence  of  machine
         instructions.
         Objects of type binary are created by _m_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n.

      _1._3._4.  _f_i_x_n_u_m   A fixnum is an integer constant in the range  -2[31]
         to 2[31]-1.  Small fixnums (-1024 to 1023) are stored in a special
         table so they needn't be allocated each time one is needed.




      _1._3._5.  _f_l_o_n_u_m   A flonum is a double precision real  number  in  the
         range  +_2.9x10[-37]  to +_1.7x10[38].  There are approximately six-
         teen decimal digits of precision.




      _1._3._6.  _b_i_g_n_u_m   A bignum is  an  integer  of  potentially  unbounded
         size.   When integer arithmetic exceeds the limits mentioned above
         the calculation is automatically  done with bignums.  Should  cal-
         culation  with bignums give a result which can be represented as a
         fixnum, then the fixnum representation will be used[].  This  con-
         traction  is  known as _i_n_t_e_g_e_r _n_o_r_m_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n.  Many Lisp functions
         assume that integers are  normalized.   If  the  user  chooses  to
         rewrite the bignum package he should take this into account.



         The functions used for the extraction and modification of parts of
         bignums may change from what is shown in the table sometime in the
         future.







____________________
9   []The current algorithms for integer arithmetic operations  will  return
(in  certain  cases) a result between +_2[30] and 2[31] as a bignum although
this could be represented as a fixnum.

      _1._3._7.  _s_t_r_i_n_g   A string is a null terminated  sequence  of  charac-
         ters.   Most  functions  of  symbols which operate on the symbol's
         print name will also work on strings.  The default  reader  syntax
         is set so that a string object is surrounded by double quotes.




      _1._3._8.  _p_o_r_t   A port is a structure which the  system  I/O  routines
         can  reference to transfer data between the Lisp system and exter-
         nal media.  Unlike other Lisp objects there  are  a  very  limited
         number  of  ports (20).  Ports are allocated by _i_n_f_i_l_e and _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
         and deallocated by _c_l_o_s_e and _r_e_s_e_t_i_o.




      _1._3._9.  _a_r_r_a_y   Arrays are rather complicated  types  and  are  fully
         described  in 9.  An array consists of a block of contiguous data,
         a function to reference that data and auxiliary fields for use  by
         the  referencing  function.  Since an array's referencing function
         is created by the user, an  array  can  have  any  form  the  user
         chooses (e.g. n-dimensional, triangular, or hash table).
         Arrays are created by the function _m_a_r_r_a_y.

FRANZ LISP                                                              1-6


      _1._3._1_0.  _v_a_l_u_e   A value cell contains a pointer to a lispval.   This
         type  is  used  mainly  by  arrays of general lisp objects.  Value
         cells are created with the _p_t_r function.




      _1._3._1_1.  _h_u_n_k   A hunk is a vector of from 1 to 128 lispvals.  Once a
         hunk  is  created  (by  _h_u_n_k or _m_a_k_h_u_n_k) it cannot grow or shrink.
         The access time for an element of a hunk is  slower  than  a  list
         cell  element  but  faster  than  an array.  Hunks are really only
         allocated in sizes which are powers of two, but can appear to  the
         user  to  be  any size in the 1 to 128 range.  Users of hunks must
         realize that (_n_o_t (_a_t_o_m '_l_i_s_p_v_a_l)) will return true if _l_i_s_p_v_a_l  is
         a  hunk.   Most  lisp systems do not have a direct test for a list
         cell and instead use the above test and assume that a true  result
         means  _l_i_s_p_v_a_l  is a list cell.  In FRANZ LISP you can use _d_t_p_r to
         check for a list cell.  Although hunks are not list cells, you can
         still  access the first two hunk elements with _c_d_r and _c_a_r and you
         can access any hunk element with _c_x_r[].  You can set the value  of
         the  first  two  elements of a hunk with _r_p_l_a_c_d and _r_p_l_a_c_a and you
         can set the value of any element of the hunk with _r_p_l_a_c_x.  A  hunk
         is  printed  by printing its contents surrounded by { and }.  How-
         ever a hunk cannot be read in in this way  in  the  standard  lisp
         system.  It is easy to write a reader macro to do this if desired.




   _1._4.  _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n   The conventions used  in  the  following  chapters
      were  designed  to give a great deal of information in a brief space.
      The first line of a function description contains the  function  name
      in bold face and then lists the arguments, if any.  The arguments all
      have names which begin with a letter and an underscore.   The  letter
      gives  the  allowable  type(s)  for  that  argument according to this
      table.











____________________
9   []In a hunk, the function _c_d_r references the first element and  _c_a_r  the
second.

      In the first line of a function description those arguments  preceded
      by  a  quote  mark  are  evaluated  (usually  before  the function is
      called).  The quoting convention is used so that we can give  a  name
      to  the  result  of  evaluating  the argument and we can describe the
      allowable types.  If an argument is not quoted it does not mean  that
      that  argument  will  not  be  evaluated,  but  rather  that if it is
      evaluated the time at which it is evaluated will be specifically men-
      tioned  in  the  function  description.   Optional arguments are sur-
      rounded  by  square  brackets.   An  ellipsis  means  zero  or   more
      occurrences of an argument of the directly preceding type.
