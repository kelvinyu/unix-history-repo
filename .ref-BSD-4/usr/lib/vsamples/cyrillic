If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be,
as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality; since, as he elsewhere
tells us, lost time is never found again; and what we call time enough,
always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing
to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity.
