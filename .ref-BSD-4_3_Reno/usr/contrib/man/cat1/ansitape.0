     _A_n_s_i_t_a_p_e reads and writes magnetic tapes written in ANSI
     standard format (called ``Files-11'' by DEC).  Tapes written
     by _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e are labeled with the first 6 characters of the
     machine name by default.  Actions are controlled by the _k_e_y
     argument.	The _k_e_y is a string of characters containing at
     most one function letter.	Other arguments to the command
     are a tape label and file names specifying which files are
     to be written onto or extracted from the tape.

     The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
     following letters:

     rr	     The named files are written at the end of the tape.
	     The cc function implies this.

     xx	     The named files are extracted from the tape.  If no
	     file argument is given, the entire contents of the
	     tape is extracted.  Note that if the tape has dupli-
	     cated file names, only the last file of a given name
	     can be extracted.

     tt	     The names of the specified files are listed each
	     time they occur on the tape.  If no file argument is
	     given, all files on the tape are listed.

     cc	     Create a new tape; writing begins at the beginning
	     of the tape instead of after the last file.  This
	     command implies rr..

     The following characters may be used in addition to the
     letter which selects the function desired.

     ff	     This argument allows the selection of a different
	     tape device. The next word in the keyargs list is
	     taken to be the full name of a device to write the
	     tape on.  The default is /dev/rmt12.

     nn	     The nn option allows the user to specify as the next
	     argument in the keyargs list, a control file con-
	     taining the names of files to put on the tape. If
	     the file name is '-', the control file will,
	     instead, be read from standard input.  The control
	     file contains one line for each file to be placed on
	     the tape.	Each line has two names, the name of the
	     file on the local machine, and the name it is to

	     have when placed on the tape.  This allows for more
	     convenient flattening of hierarchies when placing
	     them on tape.  If the second name is omitted, the
	     UNIX file name will be used on the tape also.  This
	     argument can only be used with the rr and cc func-
	     tions.

     ll	     The ll option allows the user to specify the label to
	     be placed on the tape. The next argument in the
	     keyargs list is taken as the tape label, which will
	     be space padded or truncated to six characters.
	     This option is meaningless unless cc is also speci-
	     fied.

     vv	     Normally _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e works relatively silently.  The vv
	     (verbose) option causes it to type information about
	     each file as it processes it.

     bb	     The bb option allows the user to select the blocksize
	     to be used for the tape.  By default, _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e uses
	     the maximum block size permitted by the ANSI stan-
	     dard, 2048.  Some systems will permit a much larger
	     block size, and if large files are being put on the
	     tape it may be advantageous to do so.  _A_n_s_i_t_a_p_e will
	     take the next argument of the keyargs list as the
	     blocksize for the tape.  Values below 18 or above
	     32k will be limited to that range.  The standard
	     scale factors b=512 and k=1024 are accepted.

     FF	     The FF flag allows _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e to write ansi 'D' format
	     fixed record length tapes.  The next two keyargs
	     must be the recordsize and blocksize to be used,
	     with the same scale factors and range limits as for
	     the bb option.  The files to be written by the FF flag
	     must be in fixed format on the unix end - all lines
	     should be _E_X_A_C_T_L_Y rreeccoorrddssiizzee bytes long plus a ter-
	     minating newline (which will be discarded).  Note
	     that this is exactly the same format produced by
	     _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e when reading an ansi 'D' format tape.

     _A_n_s_i_t_a_p_e will not copy directories, character or block spe-
     cial files, symbolic links, sockets, or binary executables.
     Attempts to put these on tape will result in warnings, and
     they will be skipped completely.

     A warning message will be generated when a record exceeds
     the maximum record length and the affected file will be
     truncated.

     Ansitape quietly truncates names longer than 17 characters.
     Multivolume tapes can be read (provided no files cross the
     volume boundary) but not written.
