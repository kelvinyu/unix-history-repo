     _B_i_b is a preprocessor for _n_r_o_f_f or _t_r_o_f_f(1) that formats
     citations and bibliographies.  The input files (standard
     input default) are copied to the standard output, except for
     text between [. and .] pairs, which are assumed to be key-
     words for searching a bibliographic database.  If a matching
     reference is found a citation is generated replacing the
     text.  References are collected, optionally sorted, and
     written out at a location specified by the user.  Citation
     and reference formats are controlled by the -t option.

     Reference databases are created using the _i_n_v_e_r_t utility.

     The following options are available.  Note that standard
     format styles (see the -t option) set options automatically.
     Thus if a standard format style is used the user need not
     indicate any further options for most documents.

     -aa     reduce authors first names to abbreviations.

     -ar_n_u_m  reverse the first _n_u_m author's names.  If a number
	     is not given all authors names are reversed.

     -ax     print authors last names in Caps-Small Caps style.
	     For example Budd becomes BUDD.  This style is used
	     by certain ACM publications.

     -c_s_t_r   build citations according to the template _s_t_r.  See
	     the reference format designers guide for more infor-
	     mation on templates.

     -ea     reduce editors first names to abbreviations.

     -ex     print editors last names in Caps-Small Caps style
	     (see -ax option).

     -er_n_u_m  reverse the first _n_u_m editors names.  If a number is
	     not given all editors names are reversed.

     -f      instead of collecting references, dump each refer-
	     ence immediately following the line on which the
	     citation is placed (used for footnoted references).

     -i_f_i_l_e  process the indicated file, such as a file of defin-
	     itions.  (see technical report for a description of
	     file format).

     -h      replace citations to three or more adjacent refer-
	     ence items with a hyphenated string (eg 2,3,4,5
	     becomes 2-5).  This option implies the -o option.

     -n_s_t_r   turn off indicated options.  _s_t_r must be composed of
	     the letters afhosx.

     -o      contiguous citations are ordered according the the
	     reference list before being printed (default).

     -p _f_i_l_e

     -p_f_i_l_e  instead of searching the file INDEX, search the
	     indicated reference files before searching the sys-
	     tem file.	_f_i_l_e_s is a comma separated list of
	     inverted indices, created using the _i_n_v_e_r_t utility.

     -s_s_t_r   sort references according to the template _s_t_r.

     -t _t_y_p_e

     -t_t_y_p_e  use the standard macros and switch settings for the
	     indicated style to generate citations and refer-
	     ences.  There are a number of standard styles pro-
	     vided.  In addition users can generate their own
	     style macros.  See the format designers guide for
	     details.

     _L_i_s_t_r_e_f_s formats an entire reference database file.  Options
     to _l_i_s_t_r_e_f_s are the same as for _b_i_b.

     _B_i_b was designed initially for use with the -ms macros, and
     uses a couple of the -ms macros (.ip and .lp) in its macro
     definitions.  To use it with the -me macros, prefix the file
     being sent to nroff/troff with the following macro defini-
     tions:
	       .de IP
	       .ip \$1 \$2
	       ..
	       .de LP
	       .lp
	       ..

     A file "bibmac.me" containing these macro definitions may be
     found in /usr/new/lib/bmac.
