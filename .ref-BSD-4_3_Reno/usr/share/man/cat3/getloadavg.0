     _G_e_t_l_o_a_d_a_v_g returns the number of processes in the system run
     queue averaged over various periods of time.  Up to _n_e_l_e_m
     samples are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of
     _l_o_a_d_a_v_g[]. The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples,
     representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes,
     respectively.

     If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; other-
     wise, the number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
