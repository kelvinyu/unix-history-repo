     SSttrrttooll converts the string in _n_p_t_r to a lloonngg value according
     to the given _b_a_s_e, which must be between 2 and 36 inclusive,
     or be the special value 0.

     The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space
     (as determined by iissssppaaccee; see _c_t_y_p_e(3)), followed by a sin-
     gle optional `+' or `-' sign.  If _b_a_s_e is zero or 16, the
     string may then include a `0x' prefix, and the number will
     be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero _b_a_s_e is taken as 10
     (decimal) unless the next character is `0', in which case it
     is taken as 8 (octal).

     The remainder of the string is converted to a lloonngg value in
     the obvious manner, stopping at the first character which is
     not a valid digit in the given base.  (In bases above 10,
     the letter `A' in either upper or lower case represents 10,
     `B' represents 11, and so forth, with `Z' representing 35.)

     If _e_n_d_p_t_r is non nil, ssttrrttooll stores the address of the first
     invalid character in *_e_n_d_p_t_r.  If there were no digits at
     all, however, ssttrrttooll stores the original value of _n_p_t_r in
     *_e_n_d_p_t_r.  (Thus, if *_n_p_t_r is not '\0' but **_e_n_d_p_t_r is '\0'
     on return, the entire string was valid.)

     SSttrrttooll returns the result of the conversion, unless the
     value would underflow or overflow.  If an underflow occurs,
     ssttrrttooll returns LLOONNGG__MMIINN.  If an overflow occurs, ssttrrttooll
     returns LLOONNGG__MMAAXX.	In both cases, eerrrrnnoo is set to EERRAANNGGEE.
