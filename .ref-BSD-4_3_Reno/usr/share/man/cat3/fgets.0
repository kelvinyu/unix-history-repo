     The _f_g_e_t_s function reads at most one less than the number of
     characters specified by _n from the stream pointed to by
     _s_t_r_e_a_m into the array pointed to by _s.  No additional char-
     acters are read after a new-line character (which is
     retained) or after end-of-file.  A null character is written
     immediately after the last character read into the array.

     The _f_g_e_t_s function returns _s if successful.  If end-of-file
     is encountered and no characters have been read into the
     array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a null
     pointer is returned.  If a read error occurs during the
     operation, the array contents are indeterminate and a null
     pointer is returned.
