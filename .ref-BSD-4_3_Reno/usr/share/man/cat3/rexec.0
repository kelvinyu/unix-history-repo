     _R_e_x_e_c looks up the host *_a_h_o_s_t using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3),
     returning -1 if the host does not exist.  Otherwise *_a_h_o_s_t
     is set to the standard name of the host.  If a username and
     password are both specified, then these are used to authen-
     ticate to the foreign host; otherwise the environment and
     then the user's ._n_e_t_r_c file in his home directory are
     searched for appropriate information.  If all this fails,
     the user is prompted for the information.

     The port _i_n_p_o_r_t specifies which well-known DARPA Internet
     port to use for the connection; the call
     ``getservbyname("exec", "tcp")'' (see _g_e_t_s_e_r_v_e_n_t(3)) will
     return a pointer to a structure, which contains the neces-
     sary port.  The protocol for connection is described in
     detail in _r_e_x_e_c_d(8).

     If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain
     of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and given to
     the remote command as ssttddiinn and ssttddoouutt.  If _f_d_2_p is non-
     zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control process will be
     setup, and a descriptor for it will be placed in *_f_d_2_p.  The
     control process will return diagnostic output from the com-
     mand (unit 2) on this channel, and will also accept bytes on
     this channel as being UNIX signal numbers, to be forwarded
     to the process group of the command.  The diagnostic infor-
     mation returned does not include remote authorization
     failure, as the secondary connection is set up after author-
     ization has been verified.  If _f_d_2_p is 0, then the ssttddeerrrr
     (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made the same as the
     ssttddoouutt and no provision is made for sending arbitrary sig-
     nals to the remote process, although you may be able to get
     its attention by using out-of-band data.
