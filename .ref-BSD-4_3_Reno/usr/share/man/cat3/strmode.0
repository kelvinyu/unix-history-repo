     _S_t_r_m_o_d_e converts a file _m_o_d_e (the type and permission infor-
     mation associated with an inode, see _s_t_a_t(2)) into a sym-
     bolic string which is stored in the location referenced by
     _b_p.  This stored string is eleven characters in length plus
     a trailing NULL.

     The first character is the inode type, and will be one of
     the following:

     -	  regular file
     b	  block special
     c	  character special
     d	  directory
     l	  symbolic link
     p	  fifo
     s	  socket
     ?	  unknown inode type

     The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions,
     in three characters each.	The first three characters are
     the permissions for the owner of the file, the second three
     for the group the file belongs to, and the third for the
     ``other'', or default, set of users.

     Permission checking is done as specifically as possible.  If
     read permission is denied to the owner of a file in the
     first set of permssions, the owner of the file will not be
     able to read the file.  This is true even if the owner is in
     the file's group and the group permissions allow reading or
     the ``other'' permissions allow reading.

     If the first character of the three character set is an
     ``r'', the file is readable for that set of users; if a dash
     ``-'', it is not readable.

     If the second character of the three character set is a
     ``w'', the file is writable for that set of users; if a dash
     ``-'', it is not writable.

     The third character is the first of the following characters
     that apply:

     S	  If the character is part of the owner permissions and
	  the file is not executable or the directory is not
	  searchable, by the owner, and the set-user-id bit is
	  set.

     S	  If the character is part of the group permissions and
	  the file is not executable or the directory is not
	  searchable, by the group, and the set-group-id bit is
	  set.

     T	  If the character is part of the other permissions and
	  the file is not executable or the directory is not
	  searchable, by others, and the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit
	  is set.

     s	  If the character is part of the owner permissions and
	  the file is executable or the directory searchable, by
	  the owner, and the set-user-id bit is set.

     s	  If the character is part of the group permissions and
	  the file is executable or the directory searchable, by
	  the group, and the set-group-id bit is set.

     t	  If the character is part of the other permissions and
	  the file is executable or the directory searchable, by
	  others, and the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

     x	  The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

     -	  None of the above apply.

     The last character is a plus sign ``+'' if any there are any
     alternate or additional access control methods associated
     with the inode, otherwise it will be a space.
