     _F_i_n_g_e_r_d is a simple protocol based on RFC742 that provides
     an interface to the Name and Finger programs at several net-
     work sites.  The program is supposed to return a friendly,
     human-oriented status report on either the system at the
     moment or a particular person in depth.  There is no
     required format and the protocol consists mostly of specify-
     ing a single ``command line''.

     _F_i_n_g_e_r_d listens for TCP requests at port 79.  Once connected
     it reads a single command line terminated by a <CRLF> which
     is passed to _f_i_n_g_e_r(1).  _F_i_n_g_e_r_d closes its connections as
     soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a <CRLF> is sent) then _f_i_n_g_e_r
     returns a ``default'' report that lists all people logged
     into the system at that moment.

     If a user name is specified (e.g. eric<CRLF>) then the
     response lists more extended information for only that par-
     ticular user, whether logged in or not.  Allowable ``names''
     in the command line include both ``login names'' and ``user
     names''.  If a name is ambiguous, all possible derivations
     are returned.

     Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally
     narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user program can result in
     meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent to the
     server, which will foul up the command line interpretation.
     _F_i_n_g_e_r_d should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands
     received.
