     _P_o_r_t_m_a_p is a server that converts RPC program numbers into
     DARPA protocol port numbers.  It must be running in order to
     make RPC calls.

     When an RPC server is started, it will tell _p_o_r_t_m_a_p what
     port number it is listening to, and what RPC program numbers
     it is prepared to serve.  When a client wishes to make an
     RPC call to a given program number, it will first contact
     _p_o_r_t_m_a_p on the server machine to determine the port number
     where RPC packets should be sent.

     Normally, standard RPC servers are started by _i_n_e_t_d(8c), so
     _p_o_r_t_m_a_p must be started before _i_n_e_t_d is invoked.

     If _p_o_r_t_m_a_p crashes, all servers must be restarted.
