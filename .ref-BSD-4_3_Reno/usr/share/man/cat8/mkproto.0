     _M_k_p_r_o_t_o is used to bootstrap a new file system.  First a new
     file system is created using _n_e_w_f_s(8).  _M_k_p_r_o_t_o is then used
     to copy files from the old file system into the new file
     system according to the directions found in the prototype
     file _p_r_o_t_o. The prototype file contains tokens separated by
     spaces or new lines.  The first tokens comprise the specifi-
     cation for the root directory.  File specifications consist
     of tokens giving the mode, the user-id, the group id, and
     the initial contents of the file.	The syntax of the con-
     tents field depends on the mode.

     The mode token for a file is a 6 character string.  The
     first character specifies the type of the file.  (The char-
     acters --bbccdd specify regular, block special, character spe-
     cial and directory files respectively.) The second character
     of the type is either uu or -- to specify set-user-id mode or
     not.  The third is gg or -- for the set-group-id mode.  The
     rest of the mode is a three digit octal number giving the
     owner, group, and other read, write, execute permissions,
     see _c_h_m_o_d(1).

     Two decimal number tokens come after the mode; they specify
     the user and group ID's of the owner of the file.

     If the file is a regular file, the next token is a pathname
     whence the contents and size are copied.

     If the file is a block or character special file, two
     decimal number tokens follow which give the major and minor
     device numbers.

     If the file is a directory, _m_k_p_r_o_t_o makes the entries ..  and
     .... and then reads a list of names and (recursively) file
     specifications for the entries in the directory.  The scan
     is terminated with the token $$.

     A sample prototype specification follows:

	  d--777 3 1
	  usr  d--777 3 1
	       sh   ---755 3 1 /bin/sh
	       ken  d--755 6 1
		    $
	       b0   b--644 3 1 0 0
	       c0   c--644 3 1 0 0

     There should be some way to specify links.

     There should be some way to specify bad blocks.

     Mkproto can only be run on virgin file systems.  It should
     be possible to copy files into existent file systems.
