     The _m_a_k_e__k_e_y_p_a_i_r command is used to create pairs of DES keys
     for each host.  The keys are used by priviledged programs
     such as _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r(1) to make remote updates to the Kerberos
     database without having to have first acquired a Kerberos
     ticket granting ticket (TGT).  The keys created by
     _m_a_k_e__k_e_y_p_a_i_r are placed (by hand) in the filesystems of the
     kerberos server in /etc/kerberosIV/register_keys, and in the
     root directory on the clients.  For example, the file
     /.update.key128.32.130.3 would contain a copy of the key on
     the client with IP address 128.32.130.3.  These keys provide
     a shared secret which may be used to establish a secure
     channel between the client hosts and the Kerberos server.
