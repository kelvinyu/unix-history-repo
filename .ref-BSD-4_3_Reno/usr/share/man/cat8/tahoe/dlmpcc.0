     _D_l_m_p_c_c downloads CCI's Multi-Protocol Communication Con-
     troller (MPCC).  The controller provides high-speed synchro-
     nous communications for the POWER 5 and POWER 6 families of
     computers.  This utility allows you to download any or all
     of the MPCC boards.  The configuration file mmppccccttaabb deter-
     mines the protocol attributes for each MPCC board. See
     _m_p_c_c_t_a_b(4) for details.

     If you specify the command with no argument, then _d_l_m_p_c_c
     scans the configuration file and downloads all configured
     boards with corresponding protocol software. The option _n
     allows you to specify one or more MPCC boards for download-
     ing. The valid values range from 00--1155. For example, the fol-
     lowing command line orders _d_l_m_p_c_c to download only the pro-
     tocol software identified with board 2:

	     dlmpcc  2

     The next command line orders the download of the protocols
     identified with boards 0 and 3:

	     dlmpcc  0	3

     Typically, this download function is performed at boot time
     from the /etc/rc.local file with an entry similar to:
	     /usr/sbin/dlmpcc > /dev/console 2>&1
