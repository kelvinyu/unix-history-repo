     _P_a_c reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating
     the number of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster
     devices) of paper consumed by each user, and printing out
     how much each user consumed in pages or feet and dollars.
     If any _n_a_m_e_s are specified, then statistics are only printed
     for those users; usually, statistics are printed for every
     user who has used any paper.

     The --PP flag causes accounting to be done for the named
     printer.  Normally, accounting is done for the default
     printer (site dependent) or the value of the environment
     variable PPRRIINNTTEERR is used.

     The --pp flag causes the value _p_r_i_c_e to be used for the cost
     in dollars instead of the default value of 0.02 or the price
     specified in /_e_t_c/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p.

     The --cc flag causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually
     the output is sorted alphabetically by name.

     The --rr flag reverses the sorting order.

     The --ss flag causes the accounting information to be summar-
     ized on the summary accounting file; this summarization is
     necessary since on a busy system, the accounting file can
     grow by several lines per day.

     The --mm flag causes the host name to be ignored in the
     accounting file.  This allows for a user on multiple
     machines to have all of his printing charges grouped
     together.

     The relationship between the computed price and reality is
     as yet unknown.
