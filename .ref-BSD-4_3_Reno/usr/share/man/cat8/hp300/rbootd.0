     _R_b_o_o_t_d services boot requests from Hewlett-Packard worksta-
     tions over a local area network.  All boot files must reside
     in the boot file directory; further, if a client supplies
     path information in its boot request, it will be silently
     stripped away before processing.  By default, _r_b_o_o_t_d only
     responds to requests from machines listed in its configura-
     tion file.

     _R_b_o_o_t_d supports the following command line options:

     --aa   Respond to boot requests from any machine.  With this
	  option, the configuration file is ignored.

     --dd   Run server in debug mode.  Packets sent and received
	  are displayed to the terminal.

     CCoonnffiiggFFiillee
	  Specify a different configuration file.

     The configuration file consists of ascii text where each
     line describes a particular machine.  A line must start with
     a machines' _e_t_h_e_r_n_e_t _a_d_d_r_e_s_s followed by an optional list of
     _b_o_o_t _f_i_l_e _n_a_m_e_s. An ethernet address is specified in hexade-
     cimal with each of its six octets separated by a colon.  The
     boot file names come from the boot file directory.  The eth-
     ernet address and boot file(s) must be separated by white-
     space and/or commas.  A pound sign causes the remainder of a
     line to be ignored.  Here is a sample configuration file:

	 #
	 # ethernet addr    boot file(s)      comments
	 #
	 08:00:09:0:66:ad   SYSHPBSD	      # snake (4.3BSD)
	 08:00:09:0:59:5b		      # vandy (anything)
	 8::9:1:C6:75	    SYSHPBSD,SYSHPUX  # jaguar (either)

     _R_b_o_o_t_d logs status and error messages via _s_y_s_l_o_g. A startup
     message is always logged, and in the case of fatal errors
     (or deadly signals) a message is logged announcing the
     server's termination.  In general, a non-fatal error is han-
     dled by ignoring the event that caused it (e.g. an invalid
     Ethernet address in the config file causes that line to be
     invalidated).

     - If more than one server is started, both will receive and
       respond to the same boot packets.
