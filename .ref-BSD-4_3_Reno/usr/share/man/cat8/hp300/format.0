     format - how to format disks and tapes

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Currently, there are no ``native'' BSD media formatting
     utilities.  Formatting of both disks and cartridge tapes
     must be done either standalone or under HP-UX using the
     _m_e_d_i_a_i_n_i_t utility distributed by HP.  Note that HP-brand
     cartridge tapes come pre-formatted, and HP disks are sup-
     posed to.
