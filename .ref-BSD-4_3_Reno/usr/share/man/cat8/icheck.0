     NN..BB..:: _I_c_h_e_c_k is obsoleted for normal consistency checking by
     _f_s_c_k(8).

     _I_c_h_e_c_k examines a file system, builds a bit map of used
     blocks, and compares this bit map against the free map main-
     tained on the file system.  If the file system is not speci-
     fied, a set of default file systems is checked.  The normal
     output of _i_c_h_e_c_k includes a report of

	  The total number of files and the numbers of regular,
	  directory, block special and character special files.

	  The total number of blocks in use and the numbers of
	  single-, double-, and triple-indirect blocks and direc-
	  tory blocks.

	  The number of free blocks.

	  The number of blocks missing; i.e. not in any file nor
	  in any free map.

     Following the --bb option is a list of block numbers; whenever
     any of the named blocks turns up in a file, a diagnostic is
     produced.

     _I_c_h_e_c_k is faster if the raw version of the special file is
     used, since it reads the i-list many blocks at a time.

     Default file systems vary with installation.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     For duplicate blocks and bad blocks (which lie outside the
     file system) _i_c_h_e_c_k announces the difficulty, the i-number,
     and the kind of block involved.  If a read error is encoun-
     tered, the block number of the bad block is printed and
     _i_c_h_e_c_k considers it to contain 0.

BBUUGGSS
     Since _i_c_h_e_c_k is inherently two-pass in nature, extraneous
     diagnostics may be produced if applied to active file sys-
     tems.

     It believes even preposterous super-blocks and consequently
     can get core images.
