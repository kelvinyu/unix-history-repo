     _D_m is a program used to regulate game playing.  _D_m expects
     to be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to
     play.  This is done by creating symbolic links to _d_m, in the
     directory ``/usr/games'' for all of the regulated games.
     The actual binaries for these games should be placed in a
     ``hidden'' directory, ``/usr/games/hide'', that may only be
     accessed by the _d_m program.  _D_m determines if the requested
     game is available and, if so, runs it.  The file
     ``/etc/dm.conf'' controls the conditions under which games
     may be run.

     The file ``/etc/nogames'' may be used to ``turn off'' game
     playing.  If the file exists, no game playing is allowed;
     the contents of the file will be displayed to any user
     requesting a game.

     Two problems result from _d_m running the games setuid
     ``games''.  First, all games that allow users to run UNIX
     commands should carefully set both the real and effective
     user id's immediately before executing those commands.
     Probably more important is that _d_m never be setuid anything
     but ``games'' so that compromising a game will result only
     in the user's ability to play games at will.  Secondly,
     games which previously had no reason to run setuid and which
     accessed user files may have to be modified.
