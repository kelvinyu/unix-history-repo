     _C_o_m_p_a_c_t compresses the named files using an adaptive Huffman
     code.  If no file names are given, the standard input is
     compacted to the standard output.	_C_o_m_p_a_c_t operates as an
     on-line algorithm.  Each time a byte is read, it is encoded
     immediately according to the current prefix code.	This code
     is an optimal Huffman code for the set of frequencies seen
     so far.  It is unnecessary to prepend a decoding tree to the
     compressed file since the encoder and the decoder start in
     the same state and stay synchronized.  Furthermore, _c_o_m_p_a_c_t
     and _u_n_c_o_m_p_a_c_t can operate as filters.  In particular,

	  ... | compact | uncompact | ...

     operates as a (very slow) no-op.

     When an argument _f_i_l_e is given, it is compacted and the
     resulting file is placed in _f_i_l_e._C; _f_i_l_e is unlinked.  The
     first two bytes of the compacted file code the fact that the
     file is compacted.  This code is used to prohibit recompac-
     tion.

     The amount of compression to be expected depends on the type
     of file being compressed.	Typical values of compression
     are: Text (38%), Pascal Source (43%), C Source (36%) and
     Binary (19%).  These values are the percentages of file
     bytes reduced.

     _U_n_c_o_m_p_a_c_t restores the original file from a file compressed
     by _c_o_m_p_a_c_t. If no file names are given, the standard input
     is uncompacted to the standard output.

     _C_c_a_t cats the original file from a file compressed by _c_o_m_-
     _p_a_c_t, without uncompressing the file (it is just a shell
     script which directs the uncompacted output to the standard
     output).

     _C_o_m_p_a_c_t, _u_n_c_o_m_p_a_c_t, and _c_c_a_t normally do their work
     silently.	If a --vv flag is supplied, _c_o_m_p_a_c_t will report the
     compression percentage for each compacted file while _u_n_c_o_m_-
     _p_a_c_t and _c_c_a_t will print out the name of each file as
     they're uncompacted.
