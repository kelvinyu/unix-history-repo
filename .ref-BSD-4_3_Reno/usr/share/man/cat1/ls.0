     For each directory argument, _l_s lists the contents of the
     directory; for each file argument, _l_s repeats its name and
     any other information requested.  By default, the output is
     sorted alphabetically.  When no argument is given, the
     current directory is listed.  When several arguments are
     given, the arguments are first sorted appropriately, but
     file arguments are processed before directories and their
     contents.

     The options are as follows:

     --11   force one entry per line output format; this is the
	  default when output is not to a terminal.

     --AA   List all entries except for ``.'' and ``..''.  Always
	  set for the super-user.

     --aa   List all entries; in the absence of this option,
	  entries whose names begin with a period (..) are _n_o_t
	  listed.

     --CC   force multi-column output; this is the default when
	  output is to a terminal.

     --cc   Use time when file status was last changed for sorting
	  or printing.

     --dd   If argument is a directory, list only its name; often
	  used with --ll to get the status of a directory.

     --ff   Don't sort the output.

     --FF   cause directories to be marked with a trailing `/',
	  sockets with a trailing `=', symbolic links with a
	  trailing `@', and executable files with a trailing `*'.

     --gg   Include the group ownership of the file in a long out-
	  put.

     --ii   For each file, print the i-number in the first column
	  of the report.

     --kk   Modifies the -_s option, causing the sizes to be
	  reported in kilobytes.

     --LL   If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or direc-
	  tory the link references rather than the link itself.

     --ll   List in long format, giving type and mode (in the for-
	  mat described by _s_t_r_m_o_d_e(3)), number of links, owner,
	  size in bytes, and time of last modification for each
	  file.  If the file is a special file the size field
	  will instead contain the major and minor device
	  numbers.  If the file is a symbolic link the pathname
	  of the linked-to file is printed preceded by ``->''.

     --qq   force printing of non-graphic characters in file names
	  as the character `?'; this is the default when output
	  is to a terminal.

     --RR   recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     --rr   Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic or
	  oldest first as appropriate.

     --ss   Display the sizes of files and directories in 512-byte
	  blocks.

     --tt   Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by
	  name.

     --uu   Use time of last access instead of last modification
	  for sorting (with the --tt option) and/or printing (with
	  the --ll option).

     The -_1, -_C, and -_l options all override each other; the last
     one specified determines the format used.

     The -_c, and -_u options override each other; the last one
     specified determines the file time used.

     When the sizes of the files in a directory are listed, a
     total count of blocks, including indirect blocks is printed.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/passwd to get user id's for `ls -l'.
     /etc/group to get group id's for `ls -g'.

BBUUGGSS
     The option setting based on whether the output is a teletype
     is undesirable as ``ls -s'' is much different than
     ``ls -s | lpr''.  On the other hand, not doing this setting
     would make old shell scripts which used _l_s almost certain
     losers.
