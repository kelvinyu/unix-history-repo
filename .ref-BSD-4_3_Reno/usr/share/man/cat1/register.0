     The _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r command is used to register a new user with
     Kerberos.	The Kerberos server keeps record of certain
     trusted hosts from which it will accept new registrations.
     If the host on which _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r is run is trusted by Kerberos,
     the user is asked for his current password, and then a new
     password to be used with Kerberos.  A user may only register
     with Kerberos one time.
