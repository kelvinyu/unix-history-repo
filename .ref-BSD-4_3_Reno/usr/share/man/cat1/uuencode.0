     _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e and _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e are used to transmit binary files over
     transmission mediums that do not support other than simple
     ASCII data.

     _U_u_e_n_c_o_d_e reads _f_i_l_e (or by default the standard input) and
     writes an encoded version to the standard output.	The
     encoding uses only printing ASCII characters and includes
     the mode of the file and the operand _n_a_m_e for use by
     _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e.

     _U_u_d_e_c_o_d_e transforms _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e_d files (or by default, the
     standard input) into the original form.  The resulting file
     is named _n_a_m_e and will have the mode of the original file
     except that setuid and execute bits are not retained.
     _U_u_d_e_c_o_d_e ignores any leading and trailing lines.

     The following example packages up a source tree, compresses
     it, uuencodes it and mails it to a user on another system.
     When _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e is run on the target system, the file
     ``src_tree.tar.Z'' will be created which may then be
     uncompressed and extracted into the original tree.

	  tar cf - src_tree | compress | uuencode src_tree.tar.Z
	  | mail sys1!sys2!user

BBUUGGSS
     The encoded form of the file is expanded by 35% (3 bytes
     become 4 plus control information).
