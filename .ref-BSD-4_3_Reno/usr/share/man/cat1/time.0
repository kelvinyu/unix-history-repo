     The given command is executed; after it is complete, _t_i_m_e
     prints the elapsed time during the command, the time spent
     in the system, and the time spent in execution of the com-
     mand.  Times are reported in seconds.  If the --ll option is
     supplied, the contents of the _r_u_s_a_g_e structure are printed
     as well.

     On a PDP-11, the execution time can depend on what kind of
     memory the program happens to land in; the user time in MOS
     is often half what it is in core.

     The times are printed on the diagnostic output stream,
     ``stderr''.

     _T_i_m_e is a built-in command to _c_s_h(1), with a much different
     syntax.  This command is available as ``/bin/time'' to _c_s_h
     users.

BBUUGGSS
     Elapsed time is accurate to the second, while the CPU times
     are measured to the 100th second.	Thus the sum of the CPU
     times can be up to a second larger than the elapsed time.
