     When this program starts up, answering `y' to the initial `Instructions?'
     prompt yields directions; typing `n' or `RETURN' skips them.  AAddddbbiibb then
     prompts for various bibliographic fields, reads responses from the termi-
     nal, and sends output records to a _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e.  A null response (just
     `RETURN') means to leave out that field.  A minus sign `-' means to go
     back to the previous field.  A trailing backslash allows a field to be
     continued on the next line.  The repeating `Continue?' prompt allows the
     user either to resume by typing `y' or `RETURN', to quit the current
     session by typing `n' or `q', or to edit the _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e with any system ed-
     itor (.e.g.  vi, ex, edit, ed).

     The --aa option suppresses prompting for an abstract; asking for an
     abstract is the default.  Abstracts are ended with a `CTRL-d'.  The --pp
     option causes aaddddbbiibb to use a new prompting skeleton, defined in
     _p_r_o_m_p_t_f_i_l_e.  This file should contain prompt strings, a tab, and the
     key-letters to be written to the _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e.

     The most common key-letters and their meanings are given below.  AAddddbbiibb
     insulates you from these key-letters, since it gives you prompts in En-
     glish, but if you edit the bibliography file later on, you will need to
     know this information.
