     sysline - display system status on status line of a terminal

     _S_y_s_l_i_n_e runs in the background and periodically displays
     system status information on the status line of the termi-
     nal.  Not all terminals contain a status line.  Those that
     do include the h19, concept 108, Ann Arbor Ambassador,
     vt100, Televideo 925/950 and Freedom 100.	If no flags are
     given, _s_y_s_l_i_n_e displays the time of day, the current load
     average, the change in load average in the last 5 minutes,
     the number of users (followed by a `u'), the number of runn-
     able  process (followed by a `r')[VAX only], the number of
     suspended processes (followed by a `s')[VAX only], and the
     users who have logged on and off since the last status
     report.  Finally, if new mail has arrived, a summary of it
     is printed.  If there is unread mail in your mailbox, an
     asterisk will appear after the display of the number of
     users.  The display is normally in reverse video (if your
     terminal supports this in the status line) and is right jus-
     tified to reduce distraction.  Every fifth display is done
     in normal video to give the screen a chance to rest.

     If you have a file named .who in your home directory, then
     the contents of that file is printed first.  One common use
     of this feature is to alias chdir, pushd, and popd  to place
     the current directory stack in ~/.who after it changes the
     new directory.

     The following flags may be given on the command line.

     --bb          Beep once every half hour and twice every hour,
		 just like those obnoxious watches you keep hear-
		 ing.

     --cc          Clear the status line for 5 seconds before each
		 redisplay.

     --dd          Debug mode -- print status line data in human
		 readable format.

     --DD          Print out the current day/date before the time.

     --ee          Print out only the information.  Do not print
		 out the control commands necessary to put the
		 information on the bottom line.  This option is
		 useful for putting the output of _s_y_s_l_i_n_e onto
		 the mode line of an emacs window.

     --ww          Window mode -- print the status on the current
		 line of the terminal, suitable for use inside a
		 one line window.

     --HH rreemmoottee	 Print the load average on the remote host _r_e_m_o_t_e
		 [VAX only].  If the host is down, or is not
		 sending out _r_w_h_o_d packets, then the down time is
		 printed instead.  If the prefix "ucb" is
		 present, then it is removed.

     --hh          Print out the host machine's name after the time
		 [VAX only].

     --ll          Don't print the names of people who log in and
		 out.

     --mm          Don't check for mail.

     --pp          Don't report the number of process which are
		 runnable and suspended.

     --rr          Don't display in reverse video.

     ++NN          Update the status line every N seconds. The
		 default is 60 seconds.

     --qq          Don't print out diagnostic messages if something
		 goes wrong when starting up.

     --ii          Print out the process id of the _s_y_s_l_i_n_e process
		 onto standard output upon startup.  With this
		 information you can send the alarm signal to the
		 _s_y_s_l_i_n_e process to cause it to update immedi-
		 ately.  _s_y_s_l_i_n_e writes to the standard error, so
		 you can redirect the standard output into a file
		 to catch the process id.

     --ss          Print "short" form of line by left-justifying
		 _i_f_f escapes are not allowed in the status line.
		 Some terminals (the Televideos and Freedom 100
		 for example) do not allow cursor movement (or
		 other "intelligent" operations) in the status
		 line.	For these terminals, _s_y_s_l_i_n_e normally
		 uses blanks to cause right-justification.  This
		 flag will disable the adding of the blanks.

     --jj          Force the sysline output to be left justified
		 even on terminals capable of cursor movement on
		 the status line.

     If you have a file .syslinelock in your home directory, then
     _s_y_s_l_i_n_e will not update its statistics and write on your

     screen, it will just go to sleep for a minute.  This is use-
     ful if you want to momentarily disable _s_y_s_l_i_n_e. Note that it
     may take a few seconds from the time the lock file is
     created until you are guaranteed that _s_y_s_l_i_n_e will not write
     on the screen.

BBUUGGSS
     If you interrupt the display then you may find your cursor
     missing or stuck  on the status line.  The best thing to do
     is reset the terminal.
     If there is too much for one line, the excess is thrown
     away.
