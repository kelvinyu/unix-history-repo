     _O_r_d_e_r_l_i_s_t is a file containing symbols to be found in sym-
     bolfile, 1 symbol per line.

     _S_y_m_b_o_l_f_i_l_e is updated in place to put the requested symbols
     first in the symbol table, in the order specified.  This is
     done by swapping the old symbols in the required spots with
     the new ones.  If all of the order symbols are not found, an
     error is generated.

     This program was specifically designed to cut down on the
     overhead of getting symbols from /vmunix.
