     The llooggiinn command is used when a user initially signs on.	It may also be
     used at any time to change from one user to another.  This case is the
     one summarized first above and described here.  See _H_o_w _t_o _G_e_t _S_t_a_r_t_e_d
     for how to connect initially.  The invocation of llooggiinn for initial sign-
     on is made by a system program or server using the latter form of the
     command and is described below.

     If llooggiinn is invoked without an argument, it asks for a user name, and, if
     appropriate, a password.  Echoing is turned off (if possible) during the
     typing of the password, so it will not appear on the written record of
     the session.

     After a successful login, accounting files are updated and the user is
     informed of the existence of mail.  The message of the day is printed, as
     is the time of his last login.  Both are suppressed if he has a ``._h_u_s_h_-
     _l_o_g_i_n'' file in his home directory; this is mostly used to make life
     easier for non-human users, such as uucp(1).

     LLooggiinn initializes the user and group IDs and the working directory, then
     executes a command interpreter (usually csh(1)) according to specifica-
     tions found in a password file.  Argument 0 of the command interpreter is
     the name of the command interpreter with a leading dash `--'.

     Login also modifies the environment (see environ(7)) with information
     specifying home directory, command interpreter, terminal type (if
     available) and user name.

     Options:

     --pp    Causes the remainder of the environment to be preserved, otherwise
	   any previous environment is discarded.

     --hh    option is used by telnetd(8) (at initial login) and other servers
	   to list the host from which the connection was received.

     --ff    Used with a username on the command line, at initial login, to in-
	   dicate that proper authentication has already been done and that no
	   password need be requested.	This option may be used by the su-
	   peruser or by the user specified on the command line.

     If the file /_e_t_c/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n exists, llooggiinn prints its contents on the user's
     terminal and exits. This is used by shutdown(8) to stop users logging in
     when the system is about to go down.

     Login is recognized by sh(1) and csh(1) and executed directly (without
     forking).
