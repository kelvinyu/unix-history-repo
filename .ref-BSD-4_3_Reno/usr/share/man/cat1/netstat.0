     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various
     network-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form
     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data struc-
     tures according to the option selected.  Using the third form, with an
     _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the information re-
     garding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces.  The fourth
     form displays statistics about the named protocol.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA        With the default display, show the address of any protocol con-
	       trol blocks associated with sockets; used for debugging.

     --aa        With the default display, show the state of all sockets; nor-
	       mally sockets used by server processes are not shown.

     --dd        With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as
	       described below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --hh        Show the state of the IMP host table.

     --ii        Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured
	       (interfaces statically configured into a system, but not locat-
	       ed at boot time are not shown).

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
	       Show information only about this interface; used with an
	       _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l as described below.

     --mm        Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
	       network manages a private pool of memory buffers).

     --nn        Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets
	       addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This op-
	       tion may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
	       Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known
	       name for a protocol or an alias for it.	Some protocol names
	       and aliases are listed in the file /_e_t_c/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s.  A null
	       response typically means that there are no interesting numbers
	       to report.  The program will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or
	       if there is no statistics routine for it.

     --ss        Show per-protocol statistics.

     --rr        Show the routing tables.  When --ss is also present, show routing
	       statistics instead.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s__f_a_m_i_l_y
	       Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of
	       the specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y.  The following address families
	       are recognized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _n_s, for AF_NS, and _u_n_i_x, for
	       AF_UNIX.

     The arguments, _s_y_s_t_e_m and _c_o_r_e allow substitutes for the defaults
     ``_v_m_u_n_i_x'' and ``/_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m''.

     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote ad-
     dresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
     internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a net-
     work but no specific host address.  When known the host and network ad-
     dresses are displayed symbolically according to the data bases /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s
     and /_e_t_c/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an address is
     unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is printed numeri-
     cally, according to the address family.  For more information regarding
     the Internet ``dot format,'' refer to inet(3)).  Unspecified, or ``wild-
     card'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also
     displayed.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their
     status.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gate-
     way to use in forwarding packets.	The flags field shows the state of the
     route (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route is to a gateway (``G''),
     whether the route was created dynamically by a redirect (``D''), and
     whether the route has been modified by a redirect (``M'').  Direct routes
     are created for each interface attached to the local host; the gateway
     field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.  The
     refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the route.  Con-
     nection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route for the
     duration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route
     while sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a count of
     the number of packets sent using that route.  The interface entry indi-
     cates the network interface utilized for the route.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with an _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l argument, it displays a running
     count of statistics related to network interfaces.  This display consists
     of a column for the primary interface (the first interface found during
     autoconfiguration) and a column summarizing information for all inter-
     faces.  The primary interface may be replaced with another interface with
     the --II option.  The first line of each screen of information contains a
     summary since the system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of output
     show values accumulated over the preceding interval.

     The notion of errors is ill-defined.  Collisions mean something else for
     the IMP.
