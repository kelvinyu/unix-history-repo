     The cd utility changes the working directory to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     The _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is an absolute or relative pathname which becomes the new
     working directory.  The interpretation of a relative pathname by cd
     depends on the CDPATH environment variable (see below).

     The following environment variables affect the execution of cd:

     HOME      If ccdd is invoked without arguments, the HOME environment vari-
	       able is checked for a default directory name. If HOME exists
	       and contains a directory name, that directory becomes the new
	       working directory.

     CDPATH    If the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y operand does not begin with a slash (/) char-
	       acter, and the first component is not dot (.) or dot-dot (..),
	       ccdd searches for the directory relative to each directory named
	       in the CDPATH variable, in the order listed.  The new working
	       directory is set to the first matching directory found.	An
	       empty string in place of a directory pathname represents the
	       current directory.  CCdd will print the pathname of the new work-
	       ing directory if it was an element of CDPATH.  See csh(1) for
	       info on environment variables.

     The ccdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The ccdd function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
