     LLeeaarrnn gives Computer Aided Instruction courses and practice in the use of
     UNIX, the C Shell, and the Berkeley text editors.	To get started simply
     type lleeaarrnn.  If you had used lleeaarrnn before and left your last session
     without completing a subject, the program will use information in
     $_H_O_M_E/._l_e_a_r_n_r_c to start you up in the same place you left off.  Your
     first time through, lleeaarrnn will ask questions to find out what you want to
     do.  Some questions may be bypassed by naming a _s_u_b_j_e_c_t, and more yet by
     naming a _l_e_s_s_o_n.  You may enter the _l_e_s_s_o_n as a number that lleeaarrnn gave
     you in a previous session.  If you do not know the lesson number, you may
     enter the _l_e_s_s_o_n as a word, and lleeaarrnn will look for the first lesson con-
     taining it.  If the _l_e_s_s_o_n is `--', lleeaarrnn prompts for each lesson; this is
     useful for debugging.

     The _s_u_b_j_e_c_t's presently handled are

	   files
	   editor
	   vi
	   morefiles
	   macros
	   eqn
	   C

     There are a few special commands.	The command `bye' terminates a lleeaarrnn
     session and `where' tells you of your progress, with `where m' telling
     you more.	The command `again' re-displays the text of the lesson and
     `again  _l_e_s_s_o_n' lets you review _l_e_s_s_o_n.  There is no way for lleeaarrnn to
     tell you the answers it expects in English, however, the command `hint'
     prints the last part of the lesson script used to evaluate a response,
     while `hint m' prints the whole lesson script.  This is useful for debug-
     ging lessons and might possibly give you an idea about what it expects.

     Normally, lesson scripts are found in the directory /usr/lib/learn.  The
     --ddiirreeccttoorryy option allows one to specify a nonstandard place to look for
     scripts.

BBUUGGSS
     The main strength of lleeaarrnn, that it asks the student to use the real
     UNIX, also makes possible baffling mistakes.  It is helpful, especially
     for nonprogrammers, to have a UNIX initiate near at hand during the first
     sessions.

     Occasionally lessons are incorrect, sometimes because the local version
     of a command operates in a non-standard way.  Occasionally a lesson
     script does not recognize all the different correct responses, in which
     case the `hint' command may be useful.  Such lessons may be skipped with
     the `skip' command, but it takes some sophistication to recognize the si-
     tuation.

     To find a _l_e_s_s_o_n given as a word, lleeaarrnn does a simple fgrep(1) through
     the lessons.  It is unclear whether this sort of subject indexing is
     better than none.

     Spawning a new shell is required for each of many user and internal func-
     tions.

     The `vi' lessons are provided separately from the others.	To use them
     see your system administrator.
