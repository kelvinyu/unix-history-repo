     AArr maintains groups of files combined into a single archive file.	Its
     main use is to create and update library files as used by the loader.  It
     can be used, though, for any similar purpose.  NN..BB..:: This version of aarr
     uses a ASCII-format archive which is portable among the various machines
     running UNIX.  Programs for dealing with older formats are available: see
     arcv(8).

     KKeeyy is one character from the set --ddrrqqttppmmxx optionally concatenated with
     one or more of --vvuuaaiibbcclloo.	_A_f_i_l_e is the archive file.  The _n_a_m_e_s are con-
     stituent files in the archive file.  The meanings of the --kkeeyy characters
     are:

     --dd        Delete the named files from the archive file.

     --rr        Replace the named files in the archive file.  If the optional
	       character --uu is used with --rr then only those files with last-
	       modified dates later than the archive files are replaced.  If
	       an optional positioning character from the set --aabbii is used,
	       then the _p_o_s_n_a_m_e argument must be present and specifies that
	       new files are to be placed after --aa or before --bb or --ii _p_o_s_n_a_m_e.
	       Otherwise new files are placed at the end.

     --qq        Quickly append the named files to the end of the archive file.
	       Optional positioning characters are invalid.  The command does
	       not check whether the added members are already in the archive.
	       Useful only to avoid quadratic behavior when creating a large
	       archive piece-by-piece.

     --tt        Print a table of contents of the archive file.  If no names are
	       given, all files in the archive are tabled.  If names are
	       given, only those files are tabled.

     --pp        Print the named files in the archive.

     --mm        Move the named files to the end of the archive.	If a position-
	       ing character is present, then the _p_o_s_n_a_m_e argument must be
	       present and, as in --rr specifies where the files are to be
	       moved.

     --xx        Extract the named files.  If no names are given, all files in
	       the archive are extracted.  In neither case does --xx alter the
	       archive file. Normally the `last-modified' date of each ex-
	       tracted file is the date when it is extracted. However, if --oo
	       is used, the `last-modified' date is reset to the date recorded
	       in the archive.

     --vv        Verbose.  Under the verbose option, aarr gives a file-by-file
	       description of the making of a new archive file from the old
	       archive and the constituent files.  When used with --tt it gives
	       a long listing of all information about the files.  When used
	       with --pp, it precedes each file with a name.

     --cc        Create.	Normally aarr will create _a_f_i_l_e when it needs to.  The
	       create option suppresses the normal message that is produced
	       when _a_f_i_l_e is created.

     --ll        Local.  Normally aarr places its temporary files in the directory
	       /tmp.  This option causes them to be placed in the local direc-
	       tory.

     AArr appeared in vanilla Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The Version 7 aarr appeared in
     2.0 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     If the same file is mentioned twice in an argument list, it may be put in
     the archive twice.

     The last-modified date of a file will not be altered by the --oo option if
     the user is not the owner of the extracted file, or the super-user.
