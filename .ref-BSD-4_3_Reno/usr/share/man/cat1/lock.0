     LLoocckk requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
     and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
     repeated.	There are two other conditions under which it will terminate:
     it will timeout after some interval of time and it may be killed by some-
     one with the appropriate permission.  Options:

     --tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
	       The time limit (default 15 minutes) is changed to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
	       minutes.

     --pp        Causes lloocckk to use the user's current password instead of re-
	       questing another one.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     LLoocckk appeared in 3 BSD.
