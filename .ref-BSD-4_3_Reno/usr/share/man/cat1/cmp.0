     The cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results to
     the standard output.  Under default options, ccmmpp is silent if the files
     are the same; if they differ, the byte and line number at which the first
     difference occurred is reported.  Bytes and lines are numbered beginning
     with one.

     The following options are available:

     --ll    Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing byte values (oc-
	   tal) for each difference, respectively.

     --ss    Print nothing for differing files; return exit status only.

     The following operands are available:

     _f_i_l_e_1   A pathname of the first file to be compared.  If _f_i_l_e_1 is `--',
	     the standard input is used.

     _f_i_l_e_2   A pathname of the second file to be compared.

     The ccmmpp utility exits with one of the following values:

     0	   The files are identical.

     1	   The files are different; this includes the case where one file is
	   identical to the first part of the other.  In the latter case, if
	   the --ss option has not been specified, cmp writes to standard error
	   that EOF was reached in the shorter file (before any differences
	   were found).

     >1    An error occurred.

     The ccmmpp function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.  This manual
