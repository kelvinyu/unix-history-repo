     MMssggss is used to read system messages.  These messages are sent by mailing
     to the login `msgs' and should be short pieces of information which are
     suitable to be read once by most users of the system.

     MMssggss is normally invoked each time you login, by placing it in the file
     ._l_o_g_i_n (or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e if you use sh(1)).  It will then prompt you with the
     source and subject of each new message.  If there is no subject line, the
     first few non-blank lines of the message will be displayed.  If there is
     more to the message, you will be told how long it is and asked whether
     you wish to see the rest of the message.  The possible responses are:

     --yy        type the rest of the message.

     RREETTUURRNN    synonym for y.

     --nn        skip this message and go on to the next message.

     --	       redisplay the last message.

     --qq        drops you out of mmssggss; the next time you run the program it
	       will pick up where you left off.

     --ss        append the current message to the file ``Messages'' in the
	       current directory; `s-' will save the previously displayed mes-
	       sage. A `s' or `s-' may be followed by a space and a file name
	       to receive the message replacing the default ``Messages''.

     --mm        or `m-' causes a copy of the specified message to be placed in
	       a temporary mailbox and mail(1) to be invoked on that mailbox.
	       Both `m' and `s' accept a numeric argument in place of the `-'.

     MMssggss keeps track of the next message you will see by a number in the file
     ._m_s_g_s_r_c in your home directory.  In the directory /_v_a_r/_m_s_g_s it keeps a
     set of files whose names are the (sequential) numbers of the messages
     they represent.  The file /_v_a_r/_m_s_g_s/_b_o_u_n_d_s shows the low and high number
     of the messages in the directory so that mmssggss can quickly determine if
     there are no messages for you.  If the contents of _b_o_u_n_d_s is incorrect it
     can be fixed by removing it; mmssggss will make a new _b_o_u_n_d_s file the next
     time it is run.

     The --ss option is used for setting up the posting of messages.  The line

	   msgs: "| /usr/ucb/msgs -s"

     should be included in /_e_t_c/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s (see newaliases(1)) to enable posting
     of messages.

     The --cc option is used for performing cleanup on /_v_a_r/_m_s_g_s.  An entry with
     the --cc option should be placed in /_e_t_c/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b to run every night.  This
     will remove all messages over 21 days old.  A different expiration may be
     specified on the command line to override the default.


     Options when reading messages include:

     --ff        which causes it not to say ``No new messages.''.  This is use-
	       ful in your  ._l_o_g_i_n file since this is often the case here.

     --qq        Queries whether there are messages, printing ``There are new
	       messages.'' if there are.  The command ``msgs -q'' is often
	       used in login scripts.

     --hh        causes mmssggss to print the first part of messages only.

     --ll        option causes only locally originated messages to be reported.

     _n_u_m       A message number can be given on the command line, causing mmssggss
	       to start at the specified message rather than at the next mes-
	       sage indicated by your ._m_s_g_s_r_c file.  Thus

		     msgs -h 1

	       prints the first part of all messages.

     -_n_u_m_b_e_r   will cause mmssggss to start _n_u_m_b_e_r messages back from the one in-
	       dicated by your ._m_s_g_s_r_c file, useful for reviews of recent mes-
	       sages.

     --pp        causes long messages to be piped through more(1).

     Within mmssggss you can also go to any specific message by typing its number
     when mmssggss requests input as to what to do.

     MMssggss uses the HOME and TERM environment variables for the default home
     directory and terminal type.
