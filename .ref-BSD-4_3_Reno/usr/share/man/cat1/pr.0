     The pprr utility is a printing and pagination filter.  If multiple input
     files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written to standard
     output.  By default, the input is separated into pages, each with a
     header that includes the page number, date, time, and the file's path-
     name.  Text columns are of equal width, with at least one <blank> separa-
     tion between text columns.  Lines that do not fit into a text column are
     truncated.  If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic
     messages are suppressed until the pprr utility has completed processing.

     The following options are available:

     ++_p_a_g_e     Begin output at page number page of the formatted input.

     --_c_o_l_u_m_n   Produce output that is columns wide (default is 1) and is in
	       text column rank order.	This option should not be used with
	       --mm.  When used with --tt, use the minimum number of lines to
	       display the output.

     --ff        Use <form-feed> character for new pages, instead of the default
	       behavior that uses a sequence of <newline> characters.  Prior
	       to displaying the first page of output an <alert> character is
	       written to standard output.

     --hh_h_e_a_d_e_r
	       Use the string header as the header to be printed instead of
	       file.

     --ll_l_i_n_e_s   Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to
	       lines.  If lines is smaller than the sum of both the header and
	       trailer depths (in lines), the pr utility suppresses both the
	       header and trailer, as if the --tt option were in effect.

     --mm        Merge files.  Standard output is formatted so the pprr utility
	       writes one line from each file specified by a file operand,
	       side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in terms
	       of the number of column positions.

     --ss_c_h_a_r    Separate text columns by the single character char instead of
	       by the appropriate number of <space>s (default for char is the
	       <tab> character).

     --tt        Print neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-
	       line trailer usually supplied for each page.  Quit printing
	       after the last line of each file without spacing to the end of
	       the page.

     --ww_w_i_d_t_h   Set the width of the line to width column positions for
	       multiple text-column output only (default is 72).

     The following operands are available:

     _f_i_l_e      A pathname of a file to be printed.

     If no file operands are specified, or if a file operand is `--', the
     standard input is used.

     The standard input is used only if no file operands are specified, or if
     a file operand is `--'.

     If pr receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it flushes all
     accumulated error messages to the screen before terminating.

     The pr utility output is a paginated version of the original file (or
     files).  This pagination is optionally done using <form-feed>s or a
     sequence of <newline>s.  Page headers are generated unless the --tt option
     is specified.

     The pprr utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Error messages are written to standard error during the printing process
     (if output is redirected) or after all successful file printing is com-
     plete (when printing to a terminal).

     The pprr function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
