     mmkkddeepp - construct Makefile dependency list

     mmkkddeepp [--aapp] [--ff _d_e_p_e_n_d__f_i_l_e] [_f_l_a_g_s] _f_i_l_e ...

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     MMkkddeepp takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list of C source
     files as arguments and constructs a set of include file dependencies
     which are written into the file _d_e_p_e_n_d__f_i_l_e, or ._d_e_p_e_n_d by default.  An
     example of its use in a Makefile might be:

	   CFLAGS= -O -DDEBUG -I../include -I.
	   SRCS= file1.c file2.c

	   depend:
		mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}

     where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro CFLAGS
     is the list of flags for the C compiler.

     Options:

     --pp    mmkkddeepp produces dependencies of the form ``program: program.c'' so
	   that subsequent makes will produce _p_r_o_g_r_a_m directly from its C
	   module rather than using an intermediate ._o module.	This is useful
	   in directories that contain many programs, each of whose source is
	   contained in a single C module.

     --aa    Append to the output file, so that multiple mmkkddeepp's may be run from
	   a single Makefile.
