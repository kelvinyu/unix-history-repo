     BBiiffff informs the system whether you want to be notified when mail arrives
     during the current terminal session.  The command

	   biff y

     enables notification; the command

	   biff n

     disables it.  When mail notification is enabled, the header and first few
     lines of the message will be printed on your screen whenever mail ar-
     rives.  A `biff y' command is often included in the file ._l_o_g_i_n or
     ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e to be executed at each login.

     BBiiffff operates asynchronously.  For synchronous notification use the _M_A_I_L
     variable of sh(1) or the _m_a_i_l variable of csh(1).
