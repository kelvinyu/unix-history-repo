     _S_u requests the Kerberos password for _l_o_g_i_n (or for
     ``_l_o_g_i_n.root'', if no login is provided), and switches to
     that user and group ID after obtaining a Kerberos ticket
     granting ticket.  A shell is then invoked.  _S_u will resort
     to the local password file to find the password for _l_o_g_i_n if
     there is a Kerberos error.  If _s_u is executed by root, no
     password is requested and a shell with the appropriate user
     ID is invoked; no additional Kerberos tickets are obtained.

     By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception
     of _U_S_E_R, _H_O_M_E, and _S_H_E_L_L.	_H_O_M_E and _S_H_E_L_L are set to the
     target login's default values.  _U_S_E_R is set to the target
     login, unless the target login has a user ID of 0, in which
     case it is unmodified.  The invoked shell is the target
     login's.  This is the traditional behavior of _s_u.

     The options are as follows:

     -K   Do not attempt to use Kerberos to authenticate the
	  user.

     -f   If the invoked shell is _c_s_h(1), this option prevents it
	  from reading the ``.cshrc'' file.

     -l   Simulate a full login.  The environment is discarded
	  except for _H_O_M_E, _S_H_E_L_L, _P_A_T_H, _T_E_R_M, and _U_S_E_R.  _H_O_M_E and
	  _S_H_E_L_L are modified as above.	_U_S_E_R is set to the target
	  login.  _P_A_T_H is set to ``/bin:/usr/bin''.  _T_E_R_M is
	  imported from your current environment.  The invoked
	  shell is the target login's, and _s_u will change direc-
	  tory to the target login's home directory.

     -m   Leave the environment unmodified.  The invoked shell is
	  your login shell, and no directory changes are made.
	  As a security precaution, if the target user's shell is
	  a non-standard shell (as defined by _g_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l(3))
	  and the caller's real uid is non-zero, _s_u will fail.

     The -l and -m options are mutually exclusive; the last one
     specified overrides any previous ones.

     Only users in group 0 (normally ``wheel'') can _s_u to
     ``root''.

     By default (unless the prompt is reset by a startup file)
     the super-user prompt is set to ``#'' to remind one of its
     awesome power.
