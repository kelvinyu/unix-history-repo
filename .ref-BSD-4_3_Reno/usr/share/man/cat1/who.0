     _W_h_o, without any argument, reads the /var/run/utmp file, and
     lists the login name, terminal name, and login time for each
     user currently logged into the system.  If a single argument
     is given, _w_h_o uses that file instead of /var/run/utmp.  Typ-
     ically, that file will be /var/log/wtmp, which contains a
     record of all the logins, logouts, crashes, shutdowns and
     time changes since it was created.  In either case, each
     login will be listed with the user name, the terminal name
     (with "/dev/" suppressed), login date and time, and, if
     applicable, the host logged in from.

     If /var/log/wtmp is being used as the file, the user name
     may be empty or one of the special characters '|', '}' and
     '~'.  Logouts produce an output line without any user name.
     For more information on the special characters, see utmp(5).

     With two arguments, as in `who am I' (and also `who are
     you'), _w_h_o tells you who you are logged in as.
