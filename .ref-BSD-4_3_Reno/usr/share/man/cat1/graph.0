     GGrraapphh with no options takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as
     abscissas and ordinates of a graph.  Successive points are connected by
     straight lines.  The graph is encoded on the standard output for display
     by the plot(1) filters.

     If the coordinates of a point are followed by a nonnumeric string, that
     string is printed as a label beginning on the point.  Labels may be sur-
     rounded with quotes "...", in which case they may be empty or contain
     blanks and numbers; labels never contain newlines.

     The following options are recognized, each as a separate argument.

     --aa        Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from the in-
	       put); spacing is given by the next argument (default 1).  A
	       second optional argument is the starting point for automatic
	       abscissas (default 0 or lower limit given by --xx).

     --bb        Break (disconnect) the graph after each label in the input.

     --cc        Character string given by next argument is default label for
	       each point.

     --gg        Next argument is grid style, 0 no grid, 1 frame with ticks, 2
	       full grid (default).

     --ll        Next argument is label for graph.

     --mm        Next argument is mode (style) of connecting lines: 0 discon-
	       nected, 1 connected (default).  Some devices give distinguish-
	       able line styles for other small integers.

     --ss        Save screen, don't erase before plotting.

     --xx [_l]    If _l is present, x axis is logarithmic.	Next 1 (or 2) argu-
	       ments are lower (and upper) _x limits.  Third argument, if
	       present, is grid spacing on _x axis.  Normally these quantities
	       are determined automatically.

     --yy [_l]    Similarly for _y.

     --hh        Next argument is fraction of space for height.

     --ww        Similarly for width.

     --rr        Next argument is fraction of space to move right before plot-
	       ting.

     --uu        Similarly to move up before plotting.

     --tt        Transpose horizontal and vertical axes.	(Option --xx now applies
	       to the vertical axis.)

     A legend indicating grid range is produced with a grid unless the --ss op-
     tion is present.

     If a specified lower limit exceeds the upper limit, the axis is reversed.

BBUUGGSS
     GGrraapphh stores all points internally and drops those for which there isn't
     room.

     Segments that run out of bounds are dropped, not windowed.

     Logarithmic axes may not be reversed.
