     DDuu utility displays the block usage of files in the current directory or
     for the entire tree of a given pathname.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa    Generate an entry for each file.

     --kk    By default, dduu displays the number of blocks as returned by the
	   stat(2) system call, i.e. 512-byte blocks.  If the --kk flag is
	   specified, the number displayed is the number of 1024-byte blocks
	   with partial blocks rounded up.

     --ss    Generate only the grand total.  If neither --aa or --ss are specified,
	   an entry is generated for each directory only.

     --xx    Don't traverse any mount points.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per dduu execution.
