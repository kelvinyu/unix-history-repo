     CLNP is the connectionless-mode network protocol used by the
     connectionless-mode network service. This protocol is speci-
     fied in ISO 8473.	It may be accessed through a "raw socket"
     for debugging purposes only.  CLNP sockets are connection-
     less, and are normally used with the _s_e_n_d_t_o and _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m
     calls, though the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t(2) call may also be used to fix
     the destination for future packets (in which case the
     _r_e_a_d(2) or _r_e_c_v(2) and _w_r_i_t_e(2) or _s_e_n_d(2) system calls may
     be used).

     Outgoing packets automatically have a CLNP header prepended
     to them. Incoming packets received by the user contain the
     full CLNP header.	The following _s_e_t_s_o_c_k_o_p_t options apply to
     CLNP:

     CLNPOPT_FLAGS
	  Sets the flags which are passed to clnp when sending a
	  datagram.  Valid flags are:
	  CLNP_NO_SEG-Do not allow segmentation
	  CLNP_NO_ER-Suppress ER pdus
	  CLNP_NO_CKSUM-Do not generate the CLNP checksum

     CLNPOPT_OPTS
	  Sets CLNP options. The options must be formatted
	  exactly as specified by ISO 8473, section 7.5 "Options
	  Part." Once an option has been set, it will be sent on
	  all packets until a different option is set.

     Whenever a packet is transmitted, the globally unique qual-
     ity of service option is added to the packet. The sequencing
     preferred bit and the low transit delay bit are set in this
     option.

     If a packet is forwarded containing the globally unique
     quality of service option, and the interface through which
     the packet will be transmitted has a queue length greater
     than _c_o_n_g_e_s_t__t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d, then the congestion experienced bit
     is set in the quality of service option.

     The threshold value stored in _c_o_n_g_e_s_t__t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d may be
     changed with the _c_l_n_l_u_t_i_l utility.

     When a packet is received with the globally unique quality
     of service option present, and the congestion experienced
     bit is set, then the transport congestion control function
     is called.

     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors
     returned:

     [EISCONN]	    when trying to establish a connection on a
		    socket which already has one, or when trying
		    to send a datagram with the destination
		    address specified and the socket is already
		    connected;

     [ENOTCONN]     when trying to send a datagram, but no desti-
		    nation address is specified, and the socket
		    hasn't been connected;

     [ENOBUFS]	    when the system runs out of memory for an
		    internal data structure;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
		    when an attempt is made to create a socket
		    with a network address for which no network
		    interface exists;

     [EHOSTUNREACH] when trying to send a datagram, but no route
		    to the destination address exists.

     [EINVAL]	    when specifying unsupported options.

BBUUGGSS
     Packets are sent with the type code of 0x1d (technically an
     invalid packet type) for lack of a better way to identify
     raw CLNP packets.

     No more than MLEN bytes of options can be specified.
