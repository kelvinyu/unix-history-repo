     intro - introduction to special files and hardware support

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section describes the special files, related driver
     functions, and networking support available in the system.
     In this part of the manual, the SYNOPSIS section of each
     configurable device gives a sample specification for use in
     constructing a system description for the _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program.
     The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on
     the console and/or in the system error log /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
     due to errors in device operation; see _s_y_s_l_o_g_d(8) for more
     information.

     This section contains both devices which may be configured
     into the system, ``4'' entries, and network related informa-
     tion, ``4N'', ``4P'', and ``4F'' entries; The networking
     support is introduced in _i_n_t_r_o(4N).

     This section describes the hardware supported on the HP
     9000/300 series.  Software support for these devices comes
     in two forms.  A hardware device may be supported with a
     character or block _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r, or it may be used within
     the networking subsystem and have a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
     _d_r_i_v_e_r.  Block and character devices are accessed through
     files in the file system of a special type; c.f.  _m_k_n_o_d(8).
     Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the
     interprocess communication facilities provided by the sys-
     tem; see _s_o_c_k_e_t(2).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configura-
     tion time and the appropriate device or network interface
     driver is then compiled into the system.  When the resultant
     system is booted, the autoconfiguration facilities in the
     system probe for the device and, if found, enable the
     software support for it.  If a device does not respond at
     autoconfiguration time it is not accessible at any time
     afterwards.  To enable a device which did not autoconfigure,
     the system will have to be rebooted.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f(4).	A
     list of the supported devices is given below.

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation
     of the system.  Pseudo-devices are not listed.  Devices are

     indicated by their functional interface.  Occasionally, new
     devices of a similar type may be added simply by creating
     appropriate table entries in the driver; e.g. new CS/80
     drives.
