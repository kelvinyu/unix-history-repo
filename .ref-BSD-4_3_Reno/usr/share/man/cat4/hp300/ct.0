DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The cartridge tape interface as found in the 7946 and 9144
     products provides a standard tape drive interface as
     described in _m_t_i_o(4) with the following exceptions:

     1. There is only one density.

     2. Only the ``raw'' interface is supported.

     3. The MTIOCTOP _i_o_c_t_l is limited.	In particular, the com-
	mand, MTFSR is not supported.

     4. The MTIOCGET _i_o_c_t_l is not supported.

     5. The record size for read and write operations must be
	between 1K and 64K inclusive.

     Special files _r_c_t_0 through _r_c_t_3 refer to rewind on close
     interfaces to drives 0 to 3.  _R_c_t_4 through _r_c_t_7 refer to
     no-rewind interfaces.  _R_c_t_8 through _r_c_t_1_1 refer to streaming
     rewind on close interfaces. (Only 9144 type devices can
     stream.) _R_c_t_1_2 through _r_c_t_1_5 refer to streaming no-rewind
     interfaces.

BBUUGGSS
     Read and writes of less than 1024 bytes will not behave as
     expected.
