     gb - HP98700 ``Gatorbox'' device interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This driver is for the HP98700 and 98710 graphics devices,
     also known as the Gatorbox.  The term ``Gator'' will often
     be used, and it is not to be confused with ``Gator'' used in
     reference to an HP 9837 or 200/237 machine.  Also, the term
     Gatorbox is used for the 98700 alone, with the 98701 frame
     buffer memory or with the 98710 accelerator installed.  This
     driver merely checks for the existence of the device and
     does minimal set up, as it is expected the applications will
     initialize the device to their requirements.

     The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a sys-
     tem, in which case it will be used as the system console.
     It can also be installed as a secondary display device.  For
     the first case, the HP 98287A M.A.D. interface card should
     be set to internal control space.	This will put the frame
     buffer at the DIO address 0x200000 and the control registers
     at 0x560000.  At this address it will be the ``preferred''
     console device (see _c_o_n_s(4)).  For use as a secondary dev-
     ice, the 98287A should be set to frame buffer address
     0x300000, and to an external select code.

     It should be noted that this configuration will conflict
     with the 98547 display card which has a 2 megabyte frame
     buffer starting at address 0x200000.  The 98700 should only
     be installed as a secondary device in a machine with a 1 bit
     98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.  The _9_8_7_0_0_H _I_n_s_t_a_l_-
     _l_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e contains further configuration information.

     The _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls supported by the BSD system for the
     Gatorbox are:

     GRFIOCGINFO
	  Get Graphics Info

	  Get info about device, setting the entries in the
	  _g_r_f_i_n_f_o structure, as defined in <hpdev/grfioctl.h>.
	  For the standard 98700, the number of planes should be
	  4.  The number of colors would therefore be 15, exclud-
	  ing black.  With the 98701 option installed there will
	  be another 4 planes for a total of 8, giving 255
	  colors.

     GRFIOCON
	  Graphics On

	  Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen
	  will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame
	  buffer, using whatever colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF
	  Graphics Off

	  Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT.  The
	  frame buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP
	  Map Device to user space

	  Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once
	  the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure
	  is accessible.  The frame buffer structure describing
	  the 98700 is given in <hpdev/grf_gbreg.h>.

     GRFIOCUNMAP
	  Unmap Device

	  Unmap control registers and framebuffer space.

     For further information about the use of ioctl see the man
     page.

     A small example of opening, mapping and using the device is
     given below.  For more examples of the details on the
     behavior of the device, see the device dependent source
     files for the X Window System, in the

	      u_char *Addr, frame_buffer;
	      struct grfinfo gi;
	      int disp_fd;

		disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0",1);

		if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCGINFO, &gi) < 0) return -1;

		(void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

		Addr = (u_char *) 0;
		if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCMAP, &Addr) < 0) {
		     (void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
		     return -1;
		}
		gbox = (gboxfb *) Addr;                         /* Control Registers   */
		frame_buffer = (u_char *) Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
