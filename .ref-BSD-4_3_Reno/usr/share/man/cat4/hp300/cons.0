     cons - HP300 console interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This release supports a ``virtual'' console device used for
     kernel _p_r_i_n_t_f messages and accessed in user mode via
     /dev/console.  It is virtual in the sense that it is
     attached to a hardware interface at boot time.  Currently
     the choices are limited to: a bit-mapped display acting as
     an _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r (ITE), the builtin serial
     interface (dca), or a ``null'' console in that order.
