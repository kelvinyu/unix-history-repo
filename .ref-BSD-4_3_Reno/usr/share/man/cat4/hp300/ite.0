     TTY special files of the form ``ttye?'' are interfaces to
     the HP ITE for bit-mapped displays as implemented under BSD.
     An ITE is the main system console on most HP300 workstations
     and is the mechanism through which a user communicates with
     the machine.  If more than one display exists on a system,
     any or all can be used as ITEs with the limitation that only
     the first one opened will have a keyboard (since only one
     keyboard is supported).

     ITE devices use the HP-UX ``300h'' _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) or _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o
     entries.  However, as currently implemented, the ITE does
     not support the full range of HP-UX capabilities for this
     device.  Missing are multiple colors, underlining, blinking,
     softkeys, programmable tabs, scrolling memory and keyboard
     arrow keys.  The keyboard does not have any of the interna-
     tional character support of HP's NLS system.  It does use
     the left and right _e_x_t_e_n_d _c_h_a_r keys as meta keys, in that it
     will set the eighth bit of the character code.

     Upon booting, the kernel will first look for an ITE device
     to use as the system console (/dev/console).  If a display
     exists at any hardware address, it will be the console.  The
     kernel looks for, in order: a 98544, 98545, or 98547 Topcat
     display, a 98700 Gatorbox at a supported address (see
     _g_b(4)), or a 98720 Renaissance at a supported address (see
     _r_b(4)).  Currently there is no ITE support for the 98548,
     98549, 98550 and 98556 boards.

     When activated as an ITE (special file opened), all displays
     go through a standard initialization sequence.  The frame
     buffer is cleared, the ROM fonts are unpacked and loaded
     into off-screen storage and a cursor appears.  The ITE ini-
     tialization routine also sets the colormap entry used to
     white.  Variable colors are not used, mainly for reasons of
     simplicity.  The font pixels are all set to 0xff and the
     colormap entry corresponding to all planes is set to R=255,
     G=255 and B=255.  The actual number of planes used to
     display the characters depends on the hardware installed.
     Finally, if the keyboard HIL device is not already assigned
     to another ITE device, it is placed in ``cooked'' mode and
     assigned to this ITE.

     On most systems, a display is used both as an ITE
     (/dev/ttye? aka /dev/console) and as a graphics device
     (/dev/grf?).  In this environment, there is some interaction
     between the two uses that should be noted.  For example,
     opening /dev/grf0 will deactivate the ITE, that is, write
     over whatever may be on the ITE display.  When the graphics

     application is finished and /dev/grf0 closed, the ITE will
     be reinitialized with the frame buffer cleared and the ITE
     colormap installed.
