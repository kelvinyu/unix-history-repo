     The 98642A is a four port EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) communi-
     cations multiplexer. The 98642A has three direct-connect
     ports and one port with full modem control.

     Each line attached to the 98642A behaves as described in
     _t_t_y(4).  Input and output for each line may set to one of
     following baud rates; 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600,
     1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400. See _t_t_y(4) for
     the encoding.

     Flags is usually specified as 0xe since 3 of the 4 ports
     (1-3) do not support modem control and should be treated as
     hard-wired with carrier always present.  If port 0 does not
     have the need for modem control then flags can be specified
     as 0xf.

     Each port on the 98642A has a 128 byte input silo and a 16
     byte output silo.	Interrupts happen on a per character
     basis unless the interrupt rate for the card reaches 70
     interrupts per second at which time the driver changes to a
     16.7ms (60 interrupts per second) polling scheme until the
     interrupt rate drops.

     Total throughput per card, all ports together, is limited to
     76800 bits per second continuous input rate.
