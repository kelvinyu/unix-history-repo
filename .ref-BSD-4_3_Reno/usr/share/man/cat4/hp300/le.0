     The _l_e interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work via the AMD 7990 LANCE Ethernet chip set.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _d_e interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The use of ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying
     data on input and output is supported by the interface but
     offers no advantage due to the large HP page size.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     the adapter.

     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     The following message indicate a possible hardware error
     performing the indicated operation during autoconfiguration
     or initialization.

     respond to an initialize command during reset.  The reset
     procedure continues anyway.
