     autoconf - diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     When UNIX bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine on
     which it is running and locates controllers, drives, and
     other devices, printing out what it finds on the console.
     This procedure is driven by a system configuration table
     which is processed by _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) and compiled into each ker-
     nel.

     Autoconfiguration on the HP300s is similar to that on the
     VAX, the primary difference is in the naming conventions.
     On the HP300, if devices exist which are not configured they
     will be ignored; if devices exist of unsupported type they
     will be ignored.

     Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded
     as the root filesystem.  If that is not possible, a generic
     system will use ``rd0'' if it exists.  If such a system is
     booted with the RB_ASKNAME option (see _r_e_b_o_o_t(2)), then the
     name of the root device is read from the console terminal at
     boot time, and any available device may be used.

     You tried to boot UNIX on a cpu type which it doesn't (or at
     least this compiled version of UNIX doesn't) understand.

     hhppiibb%%dd aatt sscc%%dd,, iippll %%dd
     An HP-IB was found at sc%d (the select code) with ipl%d
     (interrupt priority level).  UNIX will call it hpib%d.

     An HP-IB disk or tape controller was found.  For disks %s%d
     will look like ``rd0'', for tapes like ``ct0''.  The %s in
     the first line will be a product type like ``7945A'' or
     ``9144''.	The slave number comes from the address select
     switches on the drive.

     A bit mapped display was found either at the ``internal''
     address (first case) or at some ``external'' select code
     (second case).  If it exists, the internal display will
     always be unit 0.

     Another peripheral controller was found at the indicated
     select code and with indicated interrupt priority level.  %s
     will be one of ``dca'' (single-port serial interfaces),
     ``dcm'' (four-port serial interfaces), or ``le'' (LAN
     cards).  The slave number comes from the address select
     switches on the interface card.
