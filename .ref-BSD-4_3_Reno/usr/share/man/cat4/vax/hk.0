     Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various
     portions of drive 0; minor devices 8 through 15 refer to
     drive 1, etc.  The standard device names begin with ``hk''
     followed by the drive number and then a letter a-h for par-
     titions 0-7 respectively.	The character ? stands here for a
     drive number in the range 0-7.

     The block files access the disk via the system's normal
     buffering mechanism and may be read and written without
     regard to physical disk records.  There is also a `raw'
     interface which provides for direct transmission between the
     disk and the user's read or write buffer.	A single read or
     write call results in exactly one I/O operation and there-
     fore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when many words
     are transmitted.  The names of the raw files conventionally
     begin with an extra `r.'

     In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk
     sector).  Likewise _s_e_e_k calls should specify a multiple of
     512 bytes.

     The origin and size (in sectors) of the pseudo-disks on each
     drive are as follows:

     RK07 partitions:
	  disk	    start     length	cyl
	  hk?a	    0	      15884	0-240
	  hk?b	    15906     10032	241-392
	  hk?c	    0	      53790	0-814
	  hk?d	    25938     15884	393-633
	  hk?f	    41844     11792	634-814
	  hk?g	    25938     27786	393-813

     RK06 partitions
	  disk	    start     length	cyl
	  hk?a	    0	      15884	0-240
	  hk?b	    15906     11154	241-409
	  hk?c	    0	      27126	0-410

     On a dual RK-07 system partition hk?a is used for the root
     for one drive and partition hk?g for the /usr file system.
     If large jobs are to be run using hk?b on both drives as
     swap area provides a 10Mbyte paging area.	Otherwise

     An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the
     specified filesystem block number(s), which are logical
     block numbers on the indicated partition.	The contents of
     the cs2, ds and er registers are printed in octal and sym-
     bolically with bits decoded.  The error was either unrecov-
     erable, or a large number of retry attempts (including
     offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
     recover the error.

     after printing the message about being not ready (which
     takes a fraction of a second) was ready.  The operation is
     recovered if no further errors occur.

     error occurred on the specified sector(s) in the specified
     disk partition. This happens normally a few times a week.
     If it happens more frequently than this the sectors where
     the errors are occurring should be checked to see if certain
     cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive or
     heads are indicated.

     detected no interrupt for an extended period while an opera-
     tion was outstanding.  This indicates a hardware or software
     failure.  There is currently a hardware/software problem
     with spinning down drives while they are being accessed
     which causes this error to occur.	The error causes a UNIBUS
     reset, and retry of the pending operations.  If the con-
     troller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
     a few seconds later.

     In raw I/O _r_e_a_d and _w_r_i_t_e(2) truncate file offsets to 512-
     byte block boundaries, and _w_r_i_t_e scribbles on the tail of
     incomplete blocks.  Thus, in programs that are likely to
     access raw devices, _r_e_a_d, _w_r_i_t_e and _l_s_e_e_k(2) should always
     deal in 512-byte multiples.

     DEC-standard error logging should be supported.

     A program to analyze the logged error information (even in
     its present reduced form) is needed.

     The partition tables for the file systems should be read off
     of each pack, as they are never quite what any single
     installation would prefer, and this would make packs more
     portable.

     The rk07 g partition size in rk.c disagrees with that in
     /etc/disktab.
