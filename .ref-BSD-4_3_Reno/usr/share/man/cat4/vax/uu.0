DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _u_u device provides access to dual DEC TU58 tape car-
     tridge drives connected to the UNIBUS via a DL11-W interface
     module.

     The interface supports only block i/o to the TU58 cassettes.
     The drives are normally manipulated with the _a_r_f_f(8V) pro-
     gram using the ``m'' and ``f'' options.

     The driver provides for an optional write and verify (read
     after write) mode that is activated by specifying the ``a''
     device.

     The TU58 is treated as a single device by the system even
     though it has two separate drives, ``uu0'' and ``uu1''. If
     there is more than one TU58 unit on a system, the extra
     drives are named ``uu2'', ``uu3'' etc.

NNOOTTEESS
     Assembly language code to assist the driver in handling the
     receipt of data (using a pseudo-dma approach) should be
     included when using this driver; specify ``options UUDMA''
     in the configuration file.

EERRRROORRSS
     The following errors may be returned:

     [ENXIO]	 Nonexistent drive (on open); offset is too large
		 or bad (undefined) ioctl code.

     [EIO]	 Open failed, the device could not be reset.

     [EBUSY]	 Drive in use.

     driver entered an illegal state.  The information printed
     indicates the illegal state, the operation currently being
     executed, the i/o count, and the block number on the
     cassette.

     sending a continuous break signal and had to be reset. This
     may indicate a hardware problem, but the driver will attempt
     to recover from the error.

     detected no interrupt for an extended period while an opera-
     tion was outstanding.  This usually indicates that one or
     more receiver interrupts were lost and the transfer is res-
     tarted.
