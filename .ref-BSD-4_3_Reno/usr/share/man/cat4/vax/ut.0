     The _u_t interface provides access to a standard tape drive
     interface as describe in _m_t_i_o(4).	Hardware implementing
     this on the VAX is typified by the System Industries SI 9700
     tape subsystem.  Tapes may be read or written at 800, 1600,
     and 6250 bpi.

     ttjj%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     ttjj%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     to write on a tape at a different density than is already
     recorded on the tape.  This message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to switch the density.

     matter indicated a corrected error at a density other than
     800bpi.  The data transferred is assumed to be correct.

     error occurred at block _b_n.  Any error is fatal on non-raw
     tape; when possible the driver will have retried the opera-
     tion which failed several times before reporting the error.

     ttjj%%dd:: lloosstt iinntteerrrruupptt.  A tape operation did not complete
     within a reasonable time, most likely because the tape was
     taken off-line during rewind or lost vacuum.  The controller
     should, but does not, give an interrupt in these cases.  The
     device will be made available again after this message, but
     any current open reference to the device will return an
     error as the operation in progress aborts.

BBUUGGSS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.
