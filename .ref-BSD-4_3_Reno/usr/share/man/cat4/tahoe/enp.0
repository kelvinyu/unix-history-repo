     The _e_n_p interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through a CMC ENP-20 controller.

     The hardware has 128 kilobytes of dual-ported memory on the
     VERSAbus. This memory is used for internal buffering by the
     board, and the interface code reads the buffer contents
     directly through the VERSAbus.  The address of this memory
     is derived from the address specified in the configuration
     file.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _a_c_e interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     Associated with each interface is a character device which
     is used to dowload, start, and reset the firmware in the
     controller.  Reading or writing the ``ram device'' reads or
     writes the writable control store in the controller.  Two
     _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls, ENPIOGO and ENPIORESET, are used to start
     and reset the firmware.

     ily; the packet was dropped.

     The hardware is not capable of talking to itself.	The
     software implements local sending and broadcast by sending
     such packets to the loop interface.  This is a kludge.

     The link level firmware does not support setting the board's
     Ethernet address.
