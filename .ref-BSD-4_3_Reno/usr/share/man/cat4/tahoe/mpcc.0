     The MPCC has two different connecter panel styles.  The 16
     port MPCC will support any combination of SYNC or ASYNC
     ports.  The 32 port MPCC will only support ASYNC ports.
     Each async line attached to the MPCC communications con-
     troller behaves as described in _t_t_y(7) and may be set to run
     at any of 16 speeds; see _t_t_y(7) for the encoding.

     Each MPCC controller uses 2 consecutive entries in the SCB
     for download/handshake, and command/response interrupts.
     These entries start at 0xa0 for the 1st controllers
     download/handshake interrupts and 0xa1 for the 1st controll-
     ers command/response.

     The MPCC controller requires a firmware download to be com-
     pleted before it can function.  See _d_l_m_p_c_c(8) and _m_p_c_c_t_a_b(4)
     for specific information on how to configure and download
     the firmware into the MPCC controller.

     A maximum of 16 MPCC communication controllers can be sup-
     ported.

     As of the 4.3BSD-tahoe release, only 16 port mpcc's work,
     and then only in async mode.  Attempting to reload firmware
     on an mpcc with active ports may crash the system.  This
     should be fixed within a short period of time; contact the
     CSRG at University of California, Berkeley, for upgrade
     information.
