     The console is available to the processor through the con-
     sole registers.  It acts like a normal terminal, except that
     a ``~'' is used to transfer commands to the console proces-
     sor when the front panel key switch is in the ``foo'' or
     ``bar'' position.

     Useful commands to the console processor include ``~h'' to
     halt the machine and ``~b'' to force a reboot.  When the
     console processor is in control, a ``#>'' prompt is
     displayed.  To continue execution after halting the machine
     with ``~h'', use ``r.''.  Refer to the Tahoe console proces-
     sor handbook for the complete list of facilities available
     through the console processor.

     The _C_P device provides direct access to the console proces-
     sor.  The _r_e_m_o_t_e device is a secondary console terminal used
     for remote diagnosis; it is normally connected to a modem.
