     _M_k_f_i_f_o creates a new fifo file with name _p_a_t_h.  The mode of
     the new file is initialized from _m_o_d_e.  (The protection part
     of the mode is modified by the process's mode mask; see
     _u_m_a_s_k(2)).

     The fifo's owner ID is set to the process's effective user
     ID.  The fifo's group ID is set to that of the parent direc-
     tory in which it is created.

     The low-order 9 bits of mode are modified by the process's
     file mode creation mask: all bits set in the process's file
     mode creation mask are cleared.  See _u_m_a_s_k(2).

     A 0 return value indicates success.  A -1 return value indi-
     cates an error, and an error code is stored in _e_r_r_n_o.

     _M_k_f_i_f_o will fail and no fifo will be created if:

     [ENOTSUPP]     The kernel has not been configured to support
		    fifo's.

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    A component of the path prefix does not
		    exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EPERM]	    The _p_a_t_h argument contains a byte with the

		    high-order bit set.

     [EROFS]	    The named file resides on a read-only file
		    system.

     [EEXIST]	    The named file exists.

     [ENOSPC]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    fifo is being placed cannot be extended
		    because there is no space left on the file
		    system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]	    There are no free inodes on the file system
		    on which the fifo is being created.

     [EDQUOT]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    fifo is being placed cannot be extended
		    because the user's quota of disk blocks on
		    the file system containing the directory has
		    been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]	    The user's quota of inodes on the file system
		    on which the fifo is being created has been
		    exhausted.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while making the direc-
		    tory entry or allocating the inode.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system.

     [EFAULT]	    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated
		    address space.
