     The file whose name is given by _p_a_t_h or referenced by the
     descriptor _f_d has its flags changed to _f_l_a_g_s.

     Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) may change the
     flags.  The owner may only change the lower 16 bits of the
     flags; the super-user may change all 32 bits of the flags.
