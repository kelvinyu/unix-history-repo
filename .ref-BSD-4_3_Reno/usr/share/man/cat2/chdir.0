     _P_a_t_h is the pathname of a directory.  _C_h_d_i_r causes this
     directory to become the current working directory, the
     starting point for path names not beginning with ``/''.

     _F_c_h_d_i_r causes the directory referenced by _f_d to become the
     current working directory, the starting point for path names
     not beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a
     process must have execute (search) access to the directory.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

     _C_h_d_i_r will fail and the current working directory will be
     unchanged if one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for any component
		    of the path name.

     [EFAULT]	    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated
		    address space.

     unchanged if one or more of the following are true:
