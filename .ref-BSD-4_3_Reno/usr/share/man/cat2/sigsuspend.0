     _S_i_g_s_u_s_p_e_n_d temporarily changes the blocked signal mask to
     the set to which _s_i_g_m_a_s_k points, and then waits for a signal
     to arrive; on return the previous set of masked signals is
     restored.	The signal mask set is usually empty to indicate
     that all signals are to be unblocked for the duration of the
     call.  The _s_i_g_s_u_s_p_e_n_d function always terminates by being
     interrupted, returning -1 with _e_r_r_n_o set to EINTR.

     In normal usage, a signal is blocked using _s_i_g_p_r_o_c_m_a_s_k(2),
     to begin a critical section, variables modified on the
     occurrence of the signal are examined to determine that
     there is no work to be done, and the process pauses awaiting
     work by using _s_i_g_s_u_s_p_e_n_d with the previous mask returned by
     _s_i_g_p_r_o_c_m_a_s_k.
