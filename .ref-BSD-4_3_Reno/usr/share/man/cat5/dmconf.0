     dm.conf - dm configuration file

     _D_m._c_o_n_f is the configuration file for the _d_m(8) program.  It
     consists of lines beginning with one of three keywords,
     ``badtty'', ``game'', and ``time''.  All other lines are
     ignored.

     Any tty listed after the keyword ``badtty'' may not have
     games played on it.  Entries consist of two white-space
     separated fields: the string ``badtty'' and the ttyname as
     returned by _t_t_y_n_a_m_e(3).  For example, to keep the uucp
     dialout, ``tty19'', from being used for games, the entry
     would be:

	  badtty    /dev/tty19

     Any day/hour combination listed after the keyword ``time''
     will disallow games during those hours.  Entries consist of
     four white-space separated fields: the string ``time'', the
     unabbreviated day of the week and the beginning and ending
     time of a period of the day when games may not be played.
     The time fields are in a 0 based, 24-hour clock.  For exam-
     ple, the following entry allows games playing before 8AM and
     after 5PM on Mondays.

	  time	    Monday    8    17

     Any game listed after the keyword ``game'' will set parame-
     ters for a specific game.	Entries consist of five white-
     space separated fields: the keyword ``game'', the name of a
     game, the highest system load average at which the game may
     be played, the maximum users allowed if the game is to be
     played, and the priority at which the game is to be run.
     Any of these fields may start with a non-numeric character,
     resulting in no game limitation or priority based on that
     field.  The game "default" controls the settings for any
     game not otherwise listed, and must be the last ``game''
     entry in the file.  Priorities may not be negative.  For
     example, the following entries limits the game ``hack'' to
     running only when the system has 10 or less users and a load
     average of 5 or less; all other games may be run any time
     the system has 15 or less users.

	  game	    hack      5    10	*
	  game	    default   *    15	*
