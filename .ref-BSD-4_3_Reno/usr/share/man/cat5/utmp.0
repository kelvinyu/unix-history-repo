     The _u_t_m_p file records information about who is currently
     using the system.	The file is a sequence of entries with
     the following structure, as defined in the include file.

	  #define UT_NAMESIZE 8
	  #define UT_LINESIZE 8
	  #define UT_HOSTSIZE 16
	  struct utmp {
	       char ut_line[UT_NAMESIZE];
	       char ut_name[UT_LINESIZE];
	       char ut_host[UT_HOSTSIZE];
	       time_t	 ut_time;
	  };

     This structure gives the name of the special file associated
     with  the	user's	terminal,  the user's login name, and the
     time of the login in the form of _t_i_m_e(3).

     The _w_t_m_p file records all logins and logouts.  A  null  user
     name  indicates a logout on the associated terminal.  Furth-
     ermore, the terminal name `~' indicates that the system  was
     rebooted  at the indicated time; in such cases the name will
     be ``shutdown''.  An adjacent pair of entries with  terminal
     names  `|'  and `{' indicate the system-maintained time just
     before and  just  after  a  _d_a_t_e  command	has  changed  the
     system's  idea  of the time.  The name for both entries will
     be ``date''.

     _W_t_m_p is maintained by  _l_o_g_i_n(1)  and  _i_n_i_t(8).   Neither  of
     these  programs  creates  the  file,  so  if  it  is removed
     record-keeping is turned off.  It is summarized  by  _l_a_s_t(1)
     and _a_c(8).
