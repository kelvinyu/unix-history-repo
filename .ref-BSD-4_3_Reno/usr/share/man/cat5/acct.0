     The _a_c_c_t(2) system call arranges for entries to be made in
     an accounting file for each process that terminates.  The
     accounting file is a sequence of entries whose layout, as
     defined by the include file is:

     If the process was created by an _e_x_e_c_v_e(2), the first 10
     characters of the filename appear in _a_c__c_o_m_m. The accounting
     flag contains bits indicating whether _e_x_e_c_v_e(2) was ever
     accomplished, and whether the process ever had super-user
     privileges.
