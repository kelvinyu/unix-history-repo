       rrlloogg prints information about RCS files.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in ccii(1).

       rrlloogg prints the following information for each  RCS  file:
       RCS  pathname, working pathname, head (i.e., the number of
       the latest revision on the trunk), default branch,  access
       list, locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of revi-
       sions, number of  revisions  selected  for  printing,  and
       descriptive  text.   This  is  followed by entries for the
       selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each
       branch.   For  each revision, rrlloogg prints revision number,
       author, date/time, state, number  of  lines  added/deleted
       (with  respect  to  the  previous revision), locker of the
       revision (if any), and log message.  All  times  are  dis-
       played  in  Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).   Without
       options, rrlloogg prints complete  information.   The  options
       below restrict this output.

       --LL  Ignore RCS files that have no locks set.  This is con-
           venient in combination with --hh, --ll, and --RR.

       --RR  Print only the name of the RCS file.  This  is  conve-
           nient  for  translating a working pathname into an RCS
           pathname.

       --hh  Print only the RCS pathname, working  pathname,  head,
           default  branch,  access  list, locks, symbolic names,
           and suffix.

       --tt  Print the same as --hh, plus the descriptive text.

       --bb  Print information about the revisions on  the  default
           branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

       --dd_d_a_t_e_s
           Print  information  about  revisions  with  a  checkin
           date/time  in  the  ranges  given  by  the  semicolon-
           separated list of _d_a_t_e_s.  A range of the form _d_1<<_d_2 or
           _d_2>>_d_1  selects  the  revisions  that  were   deposited
           between  _d_1  and _d_2 inclusive.  A range of the form <<_d

           or _d>> selects all revisions dated  _d  or  earlier.   A
           range of the form _d<< or >>_d selects all revisions dated
           _d or later.  A range of the form _d selects the single,
           latest  revision  dated  _d  or earlier.  The date/time
           strings _d, _d_1, and _d_2 are in the free format explained
           in  ccoo(1).   Quoting is normally necessary, especially
           for << and >>.  Note that the separator is a  semicolon.

       --ll[_l_o_c_k_e_r_s]
           Print  information  about  locked  revisions only.  In
           addition, if the comma-separated list _l_o_c_k_e_r_s of login
           names is given, ignore all locks other than those held
           by the _l_o_c_k_e_r_s.  For  example,  rrlloogg --LL --RR --llwwfftt RRCCSS//**
           prints the name of RCS files locked by the user wwfftt.

       --rr[_r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s]
           prints information about revisions given in the comma-
           separated list _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s of revisions and  ranges.   A
           range  _r_e_v_1::_r_e_v_2  means  revisions _r_e_v_1 to _r_e_v_2 on the
           same branch, ::_r_e_v means revisions from  the  beginning
           of  the branch up to and including _r_e_v, and _r_e_v:: means
           revisions starting with _r_e_v to the end of  the  branch
           containing  _r_e_v.   An  argument that is a branch means
           all revisions on that branch.   A  range  of  branches
           means  all revisions on the branches in that range.  A
           branch followed by a .. means the  latest  revision  in
           that  branch.   A  bare --rr with no _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s means the
           latest revision on the default  branch,  normally  the
           trunk.

       --ss_s_t_a_t_e_s
           prints   information   about   revisions  whose  state
           attributes match one of the states given in the comma-
           separated list _s_t_a_t_e_s.

       --ww[_l_o_g_i_n_s]
           prints information about revisions checked in by users
           with login names appearing in the comma-separated list
           _l_o_g_i_n_s.   If  _l_o_g_i_n_s  is  omitted, the user's login is
           assumed.

       --VV_n Emulate RCS version _n when generating logs.  See ccoo(1)
           for more.

       --xx_s_u_f_f_i_x_e_s
           Use _s_u_f_f_i_x_e_s to characterize RCS files.  See ccii(1) for
           details.

       rrlloogg prints the intersection  of  the  revisions  selected
       with  the options --dd, --ll, --ss, and --ww, intersected with the
       union of the revisions selected by --bb and --rr.

       The separator for revision ranges in the --rr option used to
       be -- instead of ::, but this leads to confusion  when  sym-
       bolic  names  contain --.  For backwards compatibility rrlloogg
       --rr still supports the old -- separator, but it warns  about
       this obsolete use.
