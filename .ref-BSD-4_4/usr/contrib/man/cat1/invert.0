       _I_n_v_e_r_t  creates	an  inverted  index to one or more files.
       _L_o_o_k_u_p retrieves	records	from files for which an	 inverted
       index  exists.	The inverted indices are intended for use
       with _b_i_b(1).

       _I_n_v_e_r_t creates one inverted index  to  all  of  its  input
       files.	The index must be stored in the	current	directory
       and may not be moved.  Input files may  be  absolute  path
       names  or  paths	 relative to the current directory.  Each
       input file is viewed as a set of	records; each record con-
       sists  of  non-blank lines; records are separated by blank
       lines.

       _L_o_o_k_u_p retrieves	records	based on its input _(_s_t_d_i_n_)_.  Each
       line  of	 input	is a retrieval request.	 All records that
       contain all of the keywords in the retrieval  request  are
       sent to _s_t_d_o_u_t_.	If there are no	matching references, ``No
       references found.'' is  sent  to	 _s_t_d_o_u_t_.    _L_o_o_k_u_p  first
       searches	 in  the user's	private	index (default INDEX) and
       then, if	no references are  found,  in  the  system  index
       (/usr/dict/papers/INDEX).   The	system index was produced
       using _i_n_v_e_r_t with the default  options;	in  general,  the
       user is advised to use the defaults.

       Keywords	are a sequence of non-white space characters with
       non-alphanumeric	characters removed.  Keywords must be  at
       least  two characters and are truncated (default	length is
       6).  Some common	words are ignored.  Some lines	of  input
       are ignored for the purpose of collecting keywords.

       The following options are available for _i_n_v_e_r_t_:

       -c _f_i_l_e

       -c_f_i_l_e  File  contains common words, one	per line.  Common
	       words   are   not   used	  as   keys.	 (Default
	       /usr/new/lib/bmac/common.)

       -k _i

       -k_i     Maximum	number	of keys	kept per record. (Default
	       100)

       -l _i

       -l_i     Maximum length of keys. (Default	6)

       -p _f_i_l_e

       -p_f_i_l_e  File is the name	of the private index file (output
	       of  _i_n_v_e_r_t).   (Default is INDEX.)  The index must
	       be stored in the	current	directory.   (Be  careful
	       of  the	second	form.  The shell will not know to
	       expand the file name.  E.g. -p~/index won't  work;
	       use -p ~/index.)

       -s      Silent.	Suppress statistics.

       -%_s_t_r   Ignore lines that begin with %x where x is in _s_t_r_.
	       (Default	is CNOPVX. See _b_i_b(1) for explanation  of
	       field names.)

       _L_o_o_k_u_p  has  only  the  options	cc, ll, and pp with the same
       meanings	as _b_i_b_.	 In particular,	the pp option can be  fol-
       lowed by	a list of comma	separated index	files.	These are
       searched	in order from left to right until  at  least  one
       reference is found.

       Messages	 indicating  trouble  accessing	files are sent on
       _s_t_d_e_r_r_.	There is  an  explicit	message	 on  _s_t_d_o_u_t  from
       _l_o_o_k_u_p if no references are found.

       _I_n_v_e_r_t	produces   a   one  line  message  of  the  form,
       %D documents   %D distinct keys	%D key occurrences.  This
       can be suppressed with the -s option.

       The  message  locate: first key (%s) matched too	many refs
       indicates that the first	key matched more references  than
       could  be stored	in memory.  The	simple solution	is to use
       a less frequently occurring key as the first  key  in  the
       citation.

BBUUGGSS
       No  attempt  is made to check the compatibility between an
       index and the files indexed.  The user must create  a  new
       index whenever the files	that are indexed are modified.
