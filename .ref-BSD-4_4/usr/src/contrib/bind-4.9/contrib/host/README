this is a newer version of host than the one in the tools/ directory,
but it was released by someone other than the original author and i did
not know about this version until too late in bind 4.9's development cycle.
if someone else wants to port it to the new resolver and remove as much
code from this hacked-up send.c as possible, i will consider replacing the
tools/ version of host with this one.		--paul vixie, april 1993
