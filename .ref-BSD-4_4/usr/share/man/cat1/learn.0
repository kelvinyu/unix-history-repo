     LLeeaarrnn gives Computer Aided Instruction courses and practice in the use of
     UNIX, the C Shell, and the Berkeley text editors.  To get started simply
     type lleeaarrnn. If you had used lleeaarrnn before and left your last session with-
     out completing a subject, the program will use information in
     _$_H_O_M_E_/_._l_e_a_r_n_r_c to start you up in the same place you left off.  Your
     first time through, lleeaarrnn will ask questions to find out what you want to
     do.  Some questions may be bypassed by naming a _s_u_b_j_e_c_t, and more yet by
     naming a _l_e_s_s_o_n. You may enter the _l_e_s_s_o_n as a number that lleeaarrnn gave you
     in a previous session.  If you do not know the lesson number, you may en-
     ter the _l_e_s_s_o_n as a word, and lleeaarrnn will look for the first lesson con-
     taining it.  If the _l_e_s_s_o_n is `--', lleeaarrnn prompts for each lesson; this is
     useful for debugging.

     The _s_u_b_j_e_c_t _'_s presently handled are

           files
           editor
           vi
           morefiles
           macros
           eqn
           C

     There are a few special commands.  The command `bye' terminates a lleeaarrnn
     session and `where' tells you of your progress, with `where m' telling
     you more.  The command `again' re-displays the text of the lesson and
     `again _l_e_s_s_o_n' lets you review _l_e_s_s_o_n. There is no way for lleeaarrnn to tell
     you the answers it expects in English, however, the command `hint' prints
     the last part of the lesson script used to evaluate a response, while
     `hint m' prints the whole lesson script.  This is useful for debugging
     lessons and might possibly give you an idea about what it expects.

     Normally, lesson scripts are found in the directory _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_a_t_a_/_l_e_a_r_n_.
     The --ddiirreeccttoorryy option allows one to specify a nonstandard place to look
     for scripts.

BBUUGGSS
     The main strength of lleeaarrnn, that it asks the student to use the real
     UNIX, also makes possible baffling mistakes.  It is helpful, especially
     for nonprogrammers, to have a UNIX initiate near at hand during the first
     sessions.

     Occasionally lessons are incorrect, sometimes because the local version
     of a command operates in a non-standard way.  Occasionally a lesson
     script does not recognize all the different correct responses, in which
     case the `hint' command may be useful.  Such lessons may be skipped with
     the `skip' command, but it takes some sophistication to recognize the
     situation.

     To find a _l_e_s_s_o_n given as a word, lleeaarrnn does a simple fgrep(1) through
     the lessons.  It is unclear whether this sort of subject indexing is bet-
     ter than none.

     Spawning a new shell is required for each of many user and internal func-
     tions.

     The vi lessons are provided separately from the others.  To use them see
     your system administrator.
