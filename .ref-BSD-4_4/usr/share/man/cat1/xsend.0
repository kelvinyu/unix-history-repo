     The xxsseenndd, xxggeett, and eennrroollll utilities initiate and conduct encrypted mail
     on top of the regular mail(1) system. To get started, one enrolls with
     the utility eennrroollll which requests a password which is then required be-
     fore the enrollee can read mail sent via xxsseenndd.

     XXsseenndd is used just like mail, but will not `cc' messages.  The regular
     mail(1) facilities delivermail stating when encrypted mail has arrived.

     The xxggeett command is used to read the encrypted mail; it requests the en-
     rolled password before allowing the receipt of mail sent with xxsseenndd.
