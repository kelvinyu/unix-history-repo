NNAAMMEE
     uuuulloogg - display UUCP log entries

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     uuuulloogg [--ss _s_y_s] [--uu _u_s_e_r]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The uuuulloogg program displays uucp(1) and uux(1) log entries from the file
     _/_v_a_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_u_u_c_p_/_L_O_G_F_I_L_E.

     Options supported by uuuulloogg:

     --ss _s_y_s        Display all entries logged which include the system named
                   _s_y_s.

     --uu _u_s_e_r       Display only entries which include the user name _u_s_e_r.

FFIILLEESS
     /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE    Logfile of all uucp events.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     uucp(1),  uux(1).

NNOOTTEESS
     Very early releases of UUCP used separate log files for each of the UUCP
     utilities; uuuulloogg was used to merge the individual logs into a master
     file.  This capability has not been necessary for some time and is no
     longer supported.

BBUUGGSS
     UUCP's recording of which user issued a request is unreliable.

     The uuuulloogg program is little more than an overspecialized version of
     grep(1).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A uuuulloogg command appeared in Version 32V AT&T UNIX.
