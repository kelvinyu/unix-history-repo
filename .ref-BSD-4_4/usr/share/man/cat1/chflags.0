     The cchhffllaaggss utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-
     fied by the _f_l_a_g_s operand.

     The options are as follows:

     --HH      When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.
             All other symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not
             followed.

     --RR      Traverse a file hierarchy.  For each file that is of type direc-
             tory, cchhffllaaggss changes the flags of all files in the file hierar-
             chy below it followed by the flags of the directory itself.

     --hh      When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, fol-
             low it.

     Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.  The following keywords are
     currently defined:

           dump    set the dump flag
           sappnd  set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
           schg    set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
           uappnd  set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
           uchg    set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

     Putting the letters ``no'' before an option causes the flag to be turned
     off.  For example:

           nodump  the file should never be dumped

     The flags of a symbolic link are immutable, so unless the --hh or --HH flag
     is set, cchhffllaaggss on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.

     The cchhffllaaggss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
