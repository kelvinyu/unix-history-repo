     UUuuqq is used to examine (and possibly delete) entries in the uucp queue.

     When listing jobs, uuuuqq uses a format reminiscent of ls.  For the long
     format, information for each job listed includes job number, number of
     files to transfer, user who spooled the job, number of bytes to send,
     type of command requested (S for sending files, R for receiving files, X
     for remote uucp), and file or command desired.

     Several options are available:

     --hh            Print only the summary lines for each system.  Summary
                   lines give system name, number of jobs for the system, and
                   total number of bytes to send.

     --ll            Specifies a long format listing.  The default is to list
                   only the job numbers sorted across the page.

     --ss_s_y_s_t_e_m      Limit output to jobs for systems whose system names begin
                   with _s_y_s_t_e_m.

     --uu_u_s_e_r        Limit output to jobs for users whose login names begin with
                   _u_s_e_r.

     --dd_j_o_b_n_o       Delete job number _j_o_b_n_o (as obtained from a previous uuuuqq
                   command) from the uucp queue.  Only the UUCP Administrator
                   is permitted to delete jobs.

     --rr_s_d_i_r        Look for files in the spooling directory _s_d_i_r instead of
                   the default directory.

     --bb_b_a_u_d        Use _b_a_u_d to compute the transfer time instead of the de-
                   fault 1200 baud.

     No information is available on work requested by the remote machine.

     The user who requests a remote uucp command is unknown.

     ``uq -l'' can be horrendously slow.
