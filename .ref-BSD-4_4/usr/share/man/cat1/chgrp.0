     The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each _f_i_l_e
     operand to the _g_r_o_u_p ID specified by the group operand.

     Options:

     --HH      When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.
             All other symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not
             followed.

     --RR      Recursively change file group IDs.  For each _f_i_l_e operand that
             names a directory, chgrp changes the group of the directory and
             all files in the file hierarchy below it.  When symbolic links
             are encountered, their group is changed, but they are not tra-
             versed.

     --ff      The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and
             doesn't query about strange modes (unless the user does not have
             proper permissions).

     --hh      When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, fol-
             low it.

     The group of a symbolic link is immutable, so unless the --hh or --HH flag is
     set, cchhggrrpp on a symbolic link is a no-op.

     Operands:

     _g_r_o_u_p  The _g_r_o_u_p can be either a group name from the group database, or a
            numeric group ID.

     _f_i_l_e   A pathname of a file whose group ID is to be modified.

     The user invoking must belong to the specified group and be the owner of
     the file, or be the super-user.

     The cchhggrrpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
