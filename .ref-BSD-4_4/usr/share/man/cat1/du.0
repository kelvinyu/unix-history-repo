     The dduu utility displays the file system block usage for each file argu-
     ment and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directo-
     ry argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy
     rooted in the current directory is displayed.  The number of blocks are
     in the same units as that returned by the stat(2) system call, i.e.
     512-byte blocks.  Partial numbers of blocks are rounded up.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.

     --ss      Display only the grand total for the specified files.

     --HH      When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.
             All other symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not
             followed.

     --hh      When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, fol-
             low it.

     --xx      Filesystem mount points are not traversed.

     DDuu references symbolic links as the links themselves unless the --HH or --hh
     flags are specified, in which case behavior is as detailed above.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per dduu execution.

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environmental variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
