     UUuusseenndd sends a file to a given location on a remote system.  The system
     need not be directly connected to the local system, but a chain of
     uucp(1) links must to connect the two systems.

     Available option:

     --mm _m_o_d_e     The mode of the file on the remote end is taken from the oc-
                 tal number given.  Otherwise, the mode of the input file will
                 be used.

     The sourcefile can be `--', meaning to use the standard input.  Both of
     these options are primarily intended for internal use of uuuusseenndd.

     The remotefile can include the _~_u_s_e_r_i_d syntax.

     If anything goes wrong any further away than the first system down the
     line, you will never hear about it.

     This command should not exist, since uucp should handle it.

     All systems along the line must have the uuuusseenndd command available and al-
     low remote execution of it.

     Some uucp systems have a bug where binary files cannot be the input to a
     uux(1) command.  If this bug exists in any system along the line, the
     file will show up severly munged.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The uuuusseenndd command appeared in 4.0BSD.
