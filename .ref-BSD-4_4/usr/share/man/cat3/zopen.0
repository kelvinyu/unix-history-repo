     The zzooppeenn() function opens the compressed file whose name is the string
     pointed to by _p_a_t_h and associates a stream with it.

     The argument _m_o_d_e points to one of the following one-character strings:

     ``r''   Open compressed file for reading.  The stream is positioned at
             the beginning of the file.

     ``w''   Truncate file to zero length or create compressed file for writ-
             ing.  The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

     Any created files will have mode "S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP |
     S_IROTH | S_IWOTH" (0666), as modified by the process' umask value (see
     umask(2)).

     Files may only be read or written.  Seek operations are not allowed.

     The _b_i_t_s argument, if non-zero, is set to the bits code limit.  If zero,
     the default is 16.  See ccoommpprreessss(_1) for more information.

     Upon successful completion zzooppeenn() returns a FILE pointer.  Otherwise,
     NULL is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the er-
     ror.

     [EINVAL]  The _m_o_d_e or _b_i_t_s arguments specified to zzooppeenn() were invalid.

     [EFTYPE]  The compressed file starts with an invalid header, or the com-
               pressed file is compressed with more bits than can be handled.

     The zzooppeenn() function may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fopen(3) or funopen(3).

     The zzooppeenn function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

     The zzooppeenn() function may not be portable to systems other than BSD.

4.4BSD                           June 9, 1993                                1
