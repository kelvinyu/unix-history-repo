     cchhoowwnn - change file owner and group

     CChhoowwnn sets the user ID and/or the group ID of the specified files.

     The options are as follows:

     --HH      When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.
             All other symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not
             followed.

     --RR      Change the user ID and/or the group ID for the file hierarchies
             rooted in the files instead of just the files themselves.

     --ff      Don't report any failure to change file owner or group, nor modi-
             fy the exit status to reflect such failures.

     --hh      When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, fol-
             low it.

     The ownership of a symbolic link is immutable, so unless the --hh or --HH
     flag is set, cchhoowwnn on a symbolic link is a no-op.

     The _o_w_n_e_r and _g_r_o_u_p operands are both optional, however, one must be
     specified.  If the _g_r_o_u_p operand is specified, it must be preceded by a
     colon (``:'') character.

     The _o_w_n_e_r may be either a numeric user ID or a user name.  If a user name
     is also a numeric user ID, the operand is used as a user name.  The _g_r_o_u_p
     may be either a numeric group ID or a group name.  If a group name is al-
     so a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a group name.

     The ownership of a file may only be altered by a super-user for obvious
     security reasons.

     The cchhoowwnn utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     Previous versions of the cchhoowwnn utility used the dot (``.'') character to
     distinguish the group name.  This has been changed to be a colon (``:'')
     character so that user and group names may contain the dot character.

     The cchhoowwnn command is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compliant.
