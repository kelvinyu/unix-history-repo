       NN..BB..::  _I_c_h_e_c_k is obsoleted for normal consistency checking
       by _f_s_c_k(8).

       _I_c_h_e_c_k examines a file system, builds a bit  map  of  used
       blocks,  and  compares  this  bit map against the free map
       maintained on the file system.  If the file system is  not
       specified,  a set of default file systems is checked.  The
       normal output of _i_c_h_e_c_k includes a report of

              The total number of files and the numbers of  regu-
              lar, directory, block special and character special
              files.

              The total number of blocks in use and  the  numbers
              of single-, double-, and triple-indirect blocks and
              directory blocks.

              The number of free blocks.

              The number of blocks missing; i.e. not in any  file
              nor in any free map.

       Following  the --bb option is a list of block numbers; when-
       ever any of the named blocks turns up in a file,  a  diag-
       nostic is produced.

       _I_c_h_e_c_k is faster if the raw version of the special file is
       used, since it reads the i-list many blocks at a time.

       For duplicate blocks and bad blocks (which lie outside the
       file  system)  _i_c_h_e_c_k  announces  the  difficulty,  the i-
       number, and the kind of block involved.  If a  read  error
       is  encountered,  the  block  number  of  the bad block is
       printed and _i_c_h_e_c_k considers it to contain 0.

       Since _i_c_h_e_c_k is inherently two-pass in nature,  extraneous
