       _C_r_o_n  executes  commands  at  specified  dates  and  times
       according to the instructions in  the  files  /etc/crontab
       and  /etc/crontab.local.   None,  either  one,  or both of
       these files may be present.  Since _c_r_o_n  never  exits,  it
       should  only  be executed once.  This is best done by run-
       ning _c_r_o_n from the initialization process through the file
       /etc/rc; see _i_n_i_t(8).

       The  crontab  files consist of lines of seven fields each.
       The fields are separated by spaces  or  tabs.   The  first
       five are integer patterns to specify:

       +o minute (0-59)

       +o hour (0-23)

       +o day of the month (1-31)

       +o month of the year (1-12)

       +o day of the week (1-7 with 1 = Monday)

       Each of these patterns may contain:

       +o a number in the range above

       +o two  numbers separated by a minus meaning a range inclu-
         sive

       +o a list of numbers separated by commas meaning any of the
         numbers

       +o an asterisk meaning all legal values

       The  sixth  field  is a user name: the command will be run
       with that user's uid and permissions.  The  seventh  field
       consists  of  all  the  text on a line following the sixth
       field, including spaces and tabs; this text is treated  as
       a  command which is executed by the Shell at the specified
       times.  A percent  character  (``%'')  in  this  field  is
       translated to a new-line character.

       Both  crontab  files  are checked by _c_r_o_n every minute, on
       the minute.
