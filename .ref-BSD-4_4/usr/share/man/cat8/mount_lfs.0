     The mmoouunntt__llffss command attaches the log-structed file system residing on
     the device named by _d_e_v_i_c_e to the global file system namespace.  The file
     system is attached at the point specified by _m_o_u_n_t___p_o_i_n_t. This command is
     normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.

     After the file system is mounted, if the --nn flag is not specified then
     the lfs_cleanerd(8) program is invoked to clean the file system periodi-
     cally.  If the --dd or --ss flags are given to mmoouunntt__llffss, they are passed to
     the cleaner.

     MMoouunntt__llffss can be run by hand if you wish to use the flags, and since the
     flags are useful mainly for debugging this doesn't make much of a differ-
     ence in normal operation.
