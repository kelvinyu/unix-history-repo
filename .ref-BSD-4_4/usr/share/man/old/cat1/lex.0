     lleexx - generator of lexical analysis programs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The lleexx command generates programs to be used in simple lexical analyis
     of text.  The input _f_i_l_e_s (standard input default) contain regular ex-
     pressions to be searched for, and actions written in C to be executed
     when expressions are found.

     A C source program, 'lex.yy.c' is generated, to be compiled thus:

           cc lex.yy.c.Fl ll

     This program, when run, copies unrecognized portions of the input to the
     output, and executes the associated C action for each regular expression
     that is recognized.

     The options have the following meanings.

     --tt      Place the result on the standard output instead of in file
             _l_e_x_._y_y_._c.

     --vv      Print a one-line summary of statistics of the generated analyzer.

     --nn      Opposite of --vv; --nn is default.

     --ff      "Faster" compilation: don't bother to pack the resulting tables;
             limited to small programs.

     would draw lleexx instructions from the file _l_e_x_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s, and place the out-
     put in _l_e_x_._y_y_._c

           %%
           [A.Em -Z] putchar(yytext[0]+'a'-'A');
           [ ]+$   ;
           [ ]+    putchar(' ');

     is an example of a lleexx program that would be put into a lleexx command file.
     This program converts upper case to lower, removes blanks at the end of
     lines, and replaces multiple blanks by single blanks.
