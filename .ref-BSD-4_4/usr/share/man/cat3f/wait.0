       _W_a_i_t causes its caller to be suspended until a  signal  is
       received or one of its child processes terminates.  If any
       child has terminated since the last _w_a_i_t_, return is  imme-
       diate;  if there are no children, return is immediate with
       an error code.

       If the returned value is positive, it is the process ID of
       the  child  and  _s_t_a_t_u_s  is  its  termination  status (see
       _w_a_i_t(2)).  If the returned value is negative,  it  is  the
       negation of a system error code.
